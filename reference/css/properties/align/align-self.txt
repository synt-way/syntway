Certainly! Here's an explanation of the CSS property `align-self`:

**`align-self` Property:**

The `align-self` property in CSS is used within a flex container to control the alignment of an individual flex item along the cross-axis, overriding the alignment set by the `align-items` property on the container.

**Example:**
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center; /* Align flex items vertically at the center */
}

.item {
  align-self: flex-start; /* Align this specific item at the start of the cross-axis */
}
```

**Why:**
The `align-self` property provides the ability to adjust the alignment of a specific flex item within a flex container. This is useful when you want a particular item to deviate from the alignment set for all items by the container's `align-items` property.

**Where:**
Apply the `align-self` property to individual flex items within a flex container where you want to control the alignment of those specific items along the cross-axis.

**How:**
Set the value of the `align-self` property to one of the available alignment values, such as `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`, and `stretch`.

**SEO:**
The `align-self` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, using it to fine-tune the alignment of specific items within a layout can contribute to a better user experience.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `align-self` property overrides the alignment set by the container's `align-items` property for the specific item it's applied to.
- It's particularly useful when you want one or a few items to have different alignment behavior than the rest.
- If an item doesn't have an explicit `align-self` value, it will inherit the value of `align-items` from the container.

**Browser Support:**
The `align-self` property is supported in modern browsers with flexbox support. As with any CSS property, it's a good practice to test your styles across different browsers to ensure consistent rendering.
