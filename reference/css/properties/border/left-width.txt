Certainly, I'd be glad to explain the `border-left-width` property:

**What is `border-left-width`?**
`border-left-width` is a CSS property used to define the width of the left border of an element. It allows you to specify how wide the left border should be displayed.

**Why is `border-left-width` used?**
When you want to control the thickness or width of the left border of an element, you use the `border-left-width` property to set that width.

**How to use `border-left-width`?**
The syntax is simple:

```css
element {
  border-left-width: width;
}
```

Replace `width` with the desired width value, such as a pixel value, percentage, em, etc.

Here's an example:

```css
/* Apply a specific width to the left border of an element */
.element {
  border-left-width: 3px;
  border-left-style: solid; /* Define border style */
  border-left-color: blue; /* Define border color */
}
```

**Additional Notes:**
- The `border-left-width` property is often used in conjunction with other border-related properties like `border-left-style` and `border-left-color`.
- By adjusting the width, you can control the prominence of the left border.

**Browser Support:**
As of my last update in September 2021, `border-left-width` is widely supported in modern browsers. However, always consider checking the latest browser compatibility data on sites like MDN Web Docs or Can I use.

I hope this clarifies the usage of the `border-left-width` property. If you have more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
