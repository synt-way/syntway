The `<th>` element, also known as the Table Header element, is used to define header cells within a table. It's typically used to mark the header row or header column cells that provide context for the content in the table's data cells (`<td>` elements). The content within `<th>` elements is often bold and centered by default, helping users distinguish header information from regular data.

Here's a detailed explanation of the `<th>` element, addressing your requested topics:

**1. What is the `<th>` Element?**
The `<th>` element is used to define header cells within a table.

**2. Why Use the `<th>` Element?**
Using the `<th>` element is important for providing semantic meaning to header content in tables. It improves accessibility and allows assistive technologies to properly identify and convey the table's structure to users.

**3. Where Can the `<th>` Element Be Used?**
The `<th>` element can be used within the `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>` sections of a `<table>` element.

**4. How to Use the `<th>` Element?**
Here's an example of how the `<th>` element can be used:

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
      <th>Country</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>John</td>
      <td>25</td>
      <td>USA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Jane</td>
      <td>30</td>
      <td>Canada</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

In this example, the first row within the `<thead>` contains `<th>` elements to define header cells for each column.

**5. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and `<th>` Elements:**
Search engines recognize the content within `<th>` elements as table headers, helping to provide context to the table's data. This can indirectly impact SEO by improving content organization.

**6. Additional Notes:**
- Scope and Headers Attributes: You can use the `scope` attribute to indicate whether a `<th>` element is a row or column header. Additionally, the `headers` attribute can establish relationships between header cells and data cells for better accessibility.

**7. Browser Support:**
The `<th>` element is supported by all modern web browsers.

Using the `<th>` element correctly enhances the semantic structure of your tables, making them more accessible and informative. It helps users understand the context of the table's content and assists screen readers in conveying the relationships between headers and data cells.
