As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the CSS property `text-decoration-thickness` was not widely supported in most browsers. However, I'll provide an explanation and example based on its intended functionality.

**What is `text-decoration-thickness`?**
`text-decoration-thickness` is a CSS property that specifies the thickness of the lines used for text decorations like underlines, overlines, and line-throughs. It allows you to control the width or thickness of these lines, providing finer control over the visual appearance of text decorations.

**Why is `text-decoration-thickness` used?**
`text-decoration-thickness` is used to customize the visual style of text decorations. By adjusting the thickness of the lines, you can create different design effects and enhance the overall aesthetics of text on a web page.

**Where is `text-decoration-thickness` applied?**
You can apply the `text-decoration-thickness` property to various HTML elements that contain text content, such as `<a>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, and others. However, browser support may be limited.

**How to use `text-decoration-thickness` with examples:**
Here's an example of how to use `text-decoration-thickness`, although keep in mind that support may be limited:

```css
.custom-decoration {
  text-decoration: underline;
  text-decoration-thickness: 2px; /* Set the thickness to 2 pixels */
}
```

In this example, the `text-decoration-thickness` property is used to set the thickness of the underline to 2 pixels.

**SEO implications:**
As of my last knowledge update, `text-decoration-thickness` had no direct impact on SEO (Search Engine Optimization). SEO primarily involves optimizing content, meta tags, and other factors to improve a website's visibility in search engine results. This property is primarily used for visual styling and does not affect the underlying content or SEO.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `text-decoration-thickness` property can accept values in various units, such as pixels (`px`) or ems (`em`), to specify the thickness of text decorations.
- Its precise behavior and availability may vary among browsers, so it's essential to check current browser compatibility when using this property.
