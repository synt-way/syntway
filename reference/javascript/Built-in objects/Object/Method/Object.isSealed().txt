The `Object.isSealed()` method in JavaScript is used to check if an object is sealed, meaning that no new properties can be added to it, and existing properties cannot be deleted or configured (e.g., their attributes cannot be changed). It returns a boolean value, indicating whether the object is sealed or not. Here's a detailed explanation:

**1. What is the `Object.isSealed()` Method?**
   - **Definition:** The `Object.isSealed()` method is a built-in JavaScript method that checks if an object is sealed, making it immutable in terms of property addition, deletion, or configuration changes.

**2. Why Use the `Object.isSealed()` Method?**
   - **Immutability and Data Integrity:** It is used when you need to ensure that an object's structure remains fixed and cannot be altered. This is useful for maintaining data integrity and security.
   - **Preventing Changes:** It helps prevent accidental or unauthorized changes to object properties.

**3. Where is the `Object.isSealed()` Method Used in JavaScript?**
   - **Data Immutability:** It is used in various JavaScript scenarios where data immutability is crucial, such as protecting configuration objects or constants.

**4. How to Use the `Object.isSealed()` Method:**
   - **Syntax:**
     ```javascript
     Object.isSealed(obj)
     ```

   - **Example 1:** Checking if an object is sealed:
     ```javascript
     const obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
     console.log(Object.isSealed(obj1)); // false

     Object.seal(obj1); // Make the object sealed
     console.log(Object.isSealed(obj1)); // true
     ```

   - **Example 2:** Attempting to add or delete properties from a sealed object:
     ```javascript
     const sealedObj = { name: "Bob" };
     Object.seal(sealedObj);

     sealedObj.age = 30; // This assignment has no effect
     delete sealedObj.name; // This deletion has no effect

     console.log(sealedObj); // { name: 'Bob' }
     ```

**5. SEO Implications:**
   - The use of the `Object.isSealed()` method in JavaScript does not have a direct impact on SEO. SEO primarily focuses on content, meta tags, and other non-technical factors.

**6. Additional Notes:**
   - Sealing an object using `Object.seal()` applies to the object itself but not its nested properties. You would need to recursively seal nested objects to make them immutable as well.
   - In strict mode, attempting to add or delete properties from a sealed object will throw a `TypeError`. In non-strict mode, it will fail silently but won't make any changes.

**7. Browser Support:**
   - The `Object.isSealed()` method is supported in all modern web browsers and JavaScript environments.

In summary, the `Object.isSealed()` method in JavaScript is used to check if an object is sealed, making it immutable in terms of property addition, deletion, or configuration changes. It is commonly used for data immutability but does not have a direct impact on SEO.
