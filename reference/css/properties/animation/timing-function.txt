The `animation-timing-function` property in CSS is used to define the pace or timing curve of an animation. It allows you to control how the intermediate states of an animation are calculated, affecting how an animation transitions between keyframes.

**Example:**
```css
.slide {
  animation: slide 2s ease-in-out infinite; /* Animation with ease-in-out timing function */
}

@keyframes slide {
  from { transform: translateX(0); }
  to { transform: translateX(100%); }
}
```

**Why:**
The `animation-timing-function` property is used to achieve specific animation effects by controlling the acceleration and deceleration of an animation. Different timing functions can create different visual experiences, from smooth and gradual transitions to snappy and sudden changes.

**Where:**
Apply the `animation-timing-function` property to the element with the animation to control the timing curve of the animation.

**How:**
The `animation-timing-function` property accepts values like:
- `ease`: The animation starts slow, accelerates in the middle, and slows down again.
- `ease-in`: The animation starts slow and accelerates.
- `ease-out`: The animation starts fast and decelerates.
- `ease-in-out`: The animation starts slow, accelerates in the middle, and then decelerates.
- `linear`: The animation progresses at a constant speed.
- `cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n)`: Specifies a custom timing function using cubic Bezier curve values.

**SEO:**
The `animation-timing-function` property and animations themselves don't have a direct impact on SEO. However, well-designed animations can enhance user experience and engagement.

**Additional Notes:**
- Different timing functions can create vastly different user perceptions of animations, so choose the one that fits your design intent.
- The `cubic-bezier` timing function allows you to define custom curves using control points, offering precise control over animation transitions.
- You can combine `animation-timing-function` with other animation properties like `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, and `animation-iteration-count` to create more complex animations.

**Browser Support:**
The `animation-timing-function` property is supported in modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It is widely supported and provides consistent behavior across these browsers.
