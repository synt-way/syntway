The `:enabled` pseudo-class in CSS is used to select and style form elements that are currently in an enabled or active state. This pseudo-class allows you to apply styles to form elements such as input fields, buttons, checkboxes, and select dropdowns that can be interacted with or modified by the user.

**Syntax:**
```css
selector:enabled {
    /* CSS rules for enabled elements */
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the `:enabled` pseudo-class:

1. **What is the `:enabled` Pseudo-Class in CSS?**
   - The `:enabled` pseudo-class selects and styles form elements that are currently in an enabled or active state. These are elements that the user can interact with or modify.

2. **Why Use the `:enabled` Pseudo-Class?**
   - You use the `:enabled` pseudo-class to provide visual cues and styles to form elements that are active and can be interacted with. It can be used to highlight elements that are currently available for user input.

3. **Where Can You Use the `:enabled` Pseudo-Class?**
   - You can use it in your CSS stylesheets to target and style various form elements, including input fields, buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, and select dropdowns.

4. **How to Use the `:enabled` Pseudo-Class?**
   - To use it, select the form element you want to style, followed by `:enabled`. Define the CSS rules inside the curly braces `{}` that follow. These rules will apply when the element is enabled.

   ```css
   input:enabled {
       border: 2px solid #0077FF; /* Blue border for enabled input fields */
       background-color: #FFFFFF; /* White background for enabled input fields */
   }
   ```

5. **SEO Considerations:**
   - The `:enabled` pseudo-class itself does not have a direct impact on SEO. SEO primarily focuses on the content and structure of HTML documents, rather than the styling applied to form elements.

6. **Additional Notes:**
   - The `:enabled` pseudo-class is often used in combination with the `:disabled` pseudo-class to style enabled and disabled form elements differently.
   - It's important to use these pseudo-classes to provide clear visual cues to users about which form elements can be interacted with and which cannot.

7. **Browser Support:**
   - Browser support for the `:enabled` pseudo-class is generally good and widely supported in modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It is a standard CSS pseudo-class and is compatible with older browser versions as well.

Here's an example of how you might use the `:enabled` pseudo-class in a CSS stylesheet to style enabled input fields with a blue border and white background:

```css
/* Style enabled input fields */
input:enabled {
    border: 2px solid #0077FF;
    background-color: #FFFFFF;
}
```

In this example, input fields that are enabled (can be interacted with) will have a blue border and white background to visually distinguish them from disabled input fields.
