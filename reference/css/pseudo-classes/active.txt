The `:active` pseudo-class in CSS is used to apply styles to an element when it is in an "active" state, typically when it's being clicked or interacted with by a user. This state is commonly used to provide visual feedback to users to indicate that an element is being clicked or activated.

**Syntax:**
```css
selector:active {
    /* CSS rules for the :active state */
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the `:active` pseudo-class:

1. **What is the `:active` Pseudo-Class in CSS?**
   - The `:active` pseudo-class targets elements in their active state, such as when a user clicks on a link or a button. It is one of the CSS pseudo-classes that allow you to style elements based on user interactions.

2. **Why Use the `:active` Pseudo-Class?**
   - You use the `:active` pseudo-class to provide visual feedback to users when they interact with elements. For example, you can change the background color or text color of a button when it's being clicked to give the user feedback that the click has been registered.

3. **Where Can You Use the `:active` Pseudo-Class?**
   - You can use it in your CSS stylesheets to target and style elements that are being actively interacted with by users, such as links (`<a>` elements), buttons, and form controls.

4. **How to Use the `:active` Pseudo-Class?**
   - To use it, select the element you want to style, followed by the `:active` pseudo-class. Define the CSS rules inside the curly braces `{}` that follow. These rules will apply when the element is in its active state.

   ```css
   a:active {
       color: red;
   }
   ```

5. **SEO Considerations:**
   - The `:active` pseudo-class itself does not have a direct impact on SEO. It is primarily a styling tool used to enhance the user experience and provide visual feedback during user interactions.

6. **Additional Notes:**
   - The `:active` state is typically brief and lasts only while the user is actively clicking or interacting with an element. Once the interaction is complete, the element returns to its normal state.
   - Be mindful of the contrast and readability of the styles applied in the `:active` state to ensure a good user experience.

7. **Browser Support:**
   - The `:active` pseudo-class is widely supported in all modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It is a standard CSS pseudo-class and is compatible with older browser versions as well.

Here's an example of how you might use the `:active` pseudo-class in a CSS stylesheet to style a link:

```css
/* Style links when they are in the :active state (clicked) */
a:active {
    color: #FF0000; /* Change text color to red when clicked */
    text-decoration: underline; /* Add an underline when clicked */
}
```

In this example, when a user clicks on a link (`<a>` element), the link text color will change to red, and an underline will be added to indicate the active state. These styles will revert to their default values once the user releases the mouse button or finishes the interaction.
