**CSS Flexible Box Layout (Flexbox)**

**What:**
CSS Flexible Box Layout, commonly known as Flexbox, is a layout model that provides an efficient way to arrange and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. It simplifies complex layouts and ensures alignment and distribution of items in a flexible and predictable manner.

**Example:**
Here's an example of creating a simple flexbox layout with three items:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .flex-container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
  }

  .flex-item {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: lightblue;
    border: 1px solid blue;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="flex-item">1</div>
  <div class="flex-item">2</div>
  <div class="flex-item">3</div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Why:**
Flexbox is used to create responsive and flexible layouts without the need for complex positioning or floating. It's particularly useful when you need to create navigation bars, equal-height columns, or vertically centered content.

**Where:**
Flexbox is applicable whenever you need to arrange items in a one-dimensional layout (either horizontally or vertically) and ensure consistent spacing and alignment.

**How:**
1. Create a flex container using `display: flex;`.
2. Adjust the layout direction using `flex-direction` (row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse).
3. Use alignment and distribution properties like `justify-content` and `align-items` to control item alignment.

**SEO:**
Flexbox itself doesn't directly impact SEO. However, it can contribute to a positive user experience by creating visually appealing and well-organized layouts, potentially leading to longer page visits and indirectly affecting SEO.

**Additional Notes:**
- Flexbox excels at handling one-dimensional layouts but might be less suitable for complex two-dimensional grids.
- Flexbox properties like `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` control the sizing and behavior of flex items.
- Combine Flexbox with other CSS features like media queries for responsive designs.

**Browser Support:**
Flexbox is widely supported by modern browsers. However, some older versions of certain browsers might have incomplete or buggy implementations. Always test your layouts across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
