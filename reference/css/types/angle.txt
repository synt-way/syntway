The term `<angle>` represents a placeholder for an angle value in CSS. Angle values are commonly used in CSS for various properties that involve rotation, positioning, and gradient direction. Let's explore `<angle>` in more detail:

**What is `<angle>` in CSS?**
In CSS, `<angle>` represents a unit of measurement for angles. It can be used to specify angles in degrees (deg), radians (rad), gradians (grad), and turns (turn), allowing you to control rotation and direction in CSS properties.

**Why is `<angle>` used?**
`<angle>` is used to control the rotation, direction, and positioning of elements in CSS. It is particularly useful when working with transforms, gradients, and properties that involve rotation, such as `transform: rotate()`, `background: linear-gradient()`, and `text-orientation`.

**Where is `<angle>` used?**
You can use `<angle>` values in various CSS properties, including but not limited to:

- `transform`: To rotate, skew, or scale elements.
- `background-image`: To control gradient angles.
- `text-orientation`: To define the orientation of text characters.

**How to use `<angle>` with examples (in CSS):**
Here are examples of how to use `<angle>` values in CSS:

1. Rotating an element using `transform`:
   
```css
/* Rotate an element by 45 degrees */
.element {
  transform: rotate(45deg);
}
```

In this example, we use the `<angle>` value `45deg` to rotate the `.element` by 45 degrees.

2. Creating a linear gradient with a specific angle:

```css
/* Create a linear gradient from top to bottom */
.gradient-box {
  background-image: linear-gradient(90deg, red, blue);
}
```

Here, `90deg` specifies a linear gradient that goes from top (red) to bottom (blue).

**SEO implications:**
The use of `<angle>` values in CSS does not have a direct impact on SEO (Search Engine Optimization). SEO primarily involves optimizing content, meta tags, and other factors to improve a website's visibility in search engine results. However, using angle values appropriately in web design and layout can contribute to a better user experience and aesthetics.

**Additional Notes:**
- Angle values can be specified in various units, such as degrees (`deg`), radians (`rad`), gradians (`grad`), and turns (`turn`). Each unit represents a different way to measure angles.
- Positive angles are measured counterclockwise, while negative angles are measured clockwise.
- When using angle values in CSS, it's essential to include the unit (e.g., `deg`, `rad`, etc.) to specify the measurement correctly.

**Browser Support:**
Support for `<angle>` values in CSS is widespread and well-supported in modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 9 and later. Angle values are a fundamental part of CSS for controlling rotation and direction in web design.
