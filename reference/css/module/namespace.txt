**CSS Namespaces**

**What:**
CSS namespaces allow you to target specific elements based on their namespace prefixes. Namespaces are particularly useful when dealing with XML-based languages like XHTML, where elements might belong to different namespaces.

**Example:**
Here's an example of using CSS namespaces to target elements in a specific namespace:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
  <style>
    @namespace myns url('http://example.com/mynamespace');
    myns|element {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

<myns:element>This is a namespaced element.</myns:element>

</body>
</html>
```

**Why:**
CSS namespaces are used to target and style elements that belong to specific namespaces in XML-based documents like XHTML. They help avoid potential conflicts between elements with the same names but different namespaces.

**Where:**
CSS namespaces are applicable when working with XML-based languages and namespaces, such as XHTML or SVG.

**How:**
1. Declare the namespace using the `@namespace` rule in your CSS.
2. Use the namespace prefix followed by the element name to target elements in that namespace.

**SEO:**
CSS namespaces don't have a direct impact on SEO. They are mainly used to ensure proper styling and avoid conflicts in XML-based documents.

**Additional Notes:**
- Namespaces are more commonly used with XML-based languages like SVG or XHTML rather than regular HTML.
- CSS namespaces are not widely used in standard HTML documents, as HTML elements don't usually have namespaces.

**Browser Support:**
Support for CSS namespaces might vary based on the type of document and the browser. Namespaces are more relevant when working with XML-based languages like SVG or XHTML. Always test your namespaces in different browsers and document types to ensure correct behavior.
