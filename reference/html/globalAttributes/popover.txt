It seems like you're asking about popovers, which are user interface elements often used to display additional information or options in a small overlay. However, popovers are typically not a standard HTML element or attribute; they are often implemented using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'll provide you with an explanation, example, and additional information about creating popovers:

**What is a Popover?**
A popover is a UI element that displays additional information, content, or options when a user interacts with a trigger element, such as a button or a link. It's often used to provide context, explanations, or actions related to the trigger element without navigating to a different page.

**Why Use Popovers?**
Popovers are used to improve user experience by presenting relevant information or actions in a non-intrusive manner, reducing the need for users to navigate away from the current context.

**Where are Popovers Used?**
Popovers can be used in various contexts, including:
- Displaying tooltips with additional information.
- Providing quick access to options or settings.
- Showing previews of content (e.g., images or text) without navigating away.

**How to Create a Popover:**
Creating a popover involves combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a simplified example:

HTML:
```html
<button class="popover-trigger">Show Popover</button>
<div class="popover-content">
  This is the popover content.
</div>
```

CSS:
```css
.popover-content {
  display: none;
  position: absolute;
  background-color: white;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  z-index: 1;
}

.popover-trigger:hover + .popover-content {
  display: block;
}
```

JavaScript (optional, for more advanced functionality):
```javascript
// You can add interactivity, close buttons, animations, etc.
```

In this example, when a user hovers over the "Show Popover" button, the associated `.popover-content` element is displayed, creating a popover effect.

**SEO and Popovers:**
The content within popovers may not be directly indexed by search engines, as it's often hidden or dynamically loaded. It's important to consider the content's visibility and accessibility for SEO purposes.

**Additional Notes:**
- Popovers can be customized with various styles and animations to match the overall design of a website or application.
- Accessibility considerations are important when implementing popovers to ensure they can be accessed by all users, including those who use assistive technologies.

**Browser Support:**
The concept of popovers itself isn't a browser-specific feature, as it's implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The techniques used to create popovers are supported by modern web browsers.
