The `Object.isFrozen()` method in JavaScript is used to check if an object is frozen, meaning that no new properties can be added to it, and existing properties cannot be modified or removed. It returns a boolean value, indicating whether the object is frozen or not. Here's a detailed explanation:

**1. What is the `Object.isFrozen()` Method?**
   - **Definition:** The `Object.isFrozen()` method is a built-in JavaScript method that checks if an object is frozen, making it immutable.

**2. Why Use the `Object.isFrozen()` Method?**
   - **Immutability:** It is used when you need to ensure that an object remains in a fixed state and cannot be altered. This is particularly useful for maintaining data integrity and security.
   - **Data Protection:** It helps protect important objects from accidental or unauthorized changes.

**3. Where is the `Object.isFrozen()` Method Used in JavaScript?**
   - **Data Immutability:** It is used in various JavaScript scenarios where data immutability is crucial, such as preventing changes to configuration objects or data models.

**4. How to Use the `Object.isFrozen()` Method:**
   - **Syntax:**
     ```javascript
     Object.isFrozen(obj)
     ```

   - **Example 1:** Checking if an object is frozen:
     ```javascript
     const obj1 = {};
     console.log(Object.isFrozen(obj1)); // false

     Object.freeze(obj1); // Make the object frozen
     console.log(Object.isFrozen(obj1)); // true
     ```

   - **Example 2:** Attempting to modify a frozen object (will throw an error in strict mode):
     ```javascript
     const obj2 = { name: "Alice" };
     Object.freeze(obj2);

     obj2.age = 30; // In strict mode, this will throw an error
     console.log(obj2); // { name: 'Alice' }
     ```

**5. SEO Implications:**
   - The use of the `Object.isFrozen()` method in JavaScript does not have a direct impact on SEO. SEO primarily focuses on content, meta tags, and other non-technical factors.

**6. Additional Notes:**
   - Freezing an object using `Object.freeze()` applies to the object itself, but not its nested properties. You would need to recursively freeze nested objects to make them immutable as well.
   - In strict mode, attempting to modify a frozen object will throw a `TypeError`. In non-strict mode, it will fail silently but won't make any changes.

**7. Browser Support:**
   - The `Object.isFrozen()` method is supported in all modern web browsers and JavaScript environments.

In summary, the `Object.isFrozen()` method in JavaScript is used to check if an object is frozen, making it immutable and preventing any changes to its properties. It is commonly used for data immutability but does not have a direct impact on SEO.
