The `accent-color` property is a CSS property introduced in the CSS Color Module Level 5 specification. It allows you to set a global accent color that is used for various user interface controls like buttons, links, and other interactive elements. The accent color helps maintain consistency and a coherent design throughout a website or application. It's important to note that browser support for this property may vary, and it might not be widely supported in older browsers.

**Example:**
```css
:root {
  accent-color: #007bff; /* Set the accent color to blue */
}

.button {
  background-color: var(--accent-color); /* Use the accent color as the background */
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

**Why:**
The `accent-color` property is used to define a primary color that can be consistently applied to interactive elements, enhancing the user experience and maintaining a unified design language. It reduces the need to manually adjust styles for various interactive components, ensuring a cohesive appearance.

**Where:**
You can apply the `accent-color` property to the `:root` pseudo-class to set a global accent color that will be used throughout the entire stylesheet.

**How:**
To use the `accent-color` property, you define a color value that you want to use as the accent color for interactive elements. This property can be used in conjunction with other styling properties to apply the accent color to different parts of your design.

**SEO:**
The `accent-color` property and its usage have no direct impact on SEO, as it's primarily a styling property that affects the visual appearance of user interface elements.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `accent-color` property simplifies the process of applying a consistent accent color to various interactive elements, improving user interface design.
- While modern browsers are likely to support this property, always consider providing fallback styles for older browsers or using CSS feature detection to ensure graceful degradation.
