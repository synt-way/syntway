Here's a comprehensive explanation of the `mix-blend-mode` property using the provided template:

### **What is `mix-blend-mode`?**
The `mix-blend-mode` property in CSS determines how the content of an element is blended with its background. It applies a blending mode to the element's content, allowing you to create a wide range of visual effects by adjusting how the colors of the element and its background interact.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `mix-blend-mode` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  mix-blend-mode: value;
}
```

Where `selector` is the target element, and `value` represents the desired blending mode.

### **Example:**
```css
.overlay {
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

In the example above, the content of the `.overlay` element will be blended with the background using the "multiply" blending mode.

### **Values of `mix-blend-mode`:**
- `normal`: The default blending mode; the content appears on top of the background.
- `multiply`: Multiplies the colors of the content and background.
- `screen`: Creates a lightening effect by inverting and multiplying colors.
- `overlay`: Combines multiply and screen effects for contrast.
- `darken`: Selects the darker of the content and background colors.
- `lighten`: Selects the lighter of the content and background colors.
