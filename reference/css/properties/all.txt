The `all` property in CSS is a shorthand property that allows you to reset all the individual properties of an element to their initial values or to inherit from its parent element. It's a powerful way to quickly reset or inherit a set of CSS properties without having to individually specify each one.

**Example:**
```css
.reset-element {
  all: initial; /* Reset all properties to their initial values */
}

.inherit-element {
  all: inherit; /* Inherit all properties from parent element */
}
```

**Why:**
The `all` property is useful when you want to quickly reset or inherit a large number of CSS properties for an element. It's especially handy for removing any previous styling and starting from a clean slate or for ensuring consistent inheritance.

**Where:**
The `all` property can be applied to any HTML element to reset or inherit all of its CSS properties. However, it's important to use this property judiciously, as it can potentially lead to unexpected layout changes if used indiscriminately.

**How:**
The `all` property accepts the values `initial` to reset properties to their initial values, `inherit` to inherit properties from the parent element, or `unset` to reset properties to their default value (either initial or inherited, depending on the property).

**SEO:**
The `all` property and its usage have no direct impact on SEO, as it's a styling property that affects the visual presentation of elements.

**Additional Notes:**
- Be cautious when using the `all` property, as it can lead to unintended side effects if not used carefully.
- It's a powerful tool for quickly resetting or inheriting properties, but it should be used sparingly and with a clear understanding of its implications.
- Not all CSS properties are affected by the `all` property. Some properties might not be reset or inherited due to browser limitations.

**Browser Support:**
The `all` property is supported in modern browsers. However, some older browsers might have limited or partial support. Always test your styles in various browsers to ensure compatibility.
