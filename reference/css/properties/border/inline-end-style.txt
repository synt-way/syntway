As of my last update in September 2021, the property `border-inline-end-style` is not a standard CSS property. However, it seems like you might be looking for a way to apply a specific border style to the end of an inline element.

If you're trying to achieve a custom visual effect using a border-like element at the end of an inline element, you can use pseudo-elements like `::after` to create that effect and then style it using standard border properties like `border-style`.

Here's a simplified example:

```css
/* Apply a custom border style at the end of an inline element */
.inline-end-border::after {
  content: "";
  display: inline-block;
  width: 10px;
  height: 2px;
  border-top: 1px dashed red; /* Set the desired border style */
  margin-left: 5px; /* Adjust as needed */
}
```

In this example, the `::after` pseudo-element is used to add a dashed red line at the end of the inline element with the class `.inline-end-border`.

Always keep in mind that CSS capabilities can evolve, and there may have been new features introduced after September 2021. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, refer to the latest CSS specifications or resources like MDN Web Docs.
