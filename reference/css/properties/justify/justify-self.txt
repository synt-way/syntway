The `justify-self` CSS property is used in a Grid Layout context to set the horizontal alignment of an individual grid item within its own grid cell along the inline (row) axis. It allows you to override the alignment set by the `justify-items` property for a specific grid item.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the `justify-self` property using the provided template:

### **What is `justify-self`?**
The `justify-self` property in CSS is used within a Grid Layout context to define the horizontal alignment of an individual grid item within its own grid cell along the inline (row) axis. It allows you to override the alignment set by the `justify-items` property for a specific grid item.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `justify-self` property is as follows:

```css
.grid-item {
  justify-self: value;
}
```

Where `grid-item` is the specific grid item you want to target, and `value` is one of the available values that determine how the grid item is aligned horizontally within its own grid cell.

### **Example:**
```css
.grid-item {
  justify-self: center;
}
```

In the example above, the `.grid-item` will be horizontally centered within its own grid cell along the row axis, regardless of the alignment set by the `justify-items` property on the grid container.

### **Values of `justify-self`:**
- `start`: Aligns the grid item to the start of its grid cell along the inline axis.
- `end`: Aligns the grid item to the end of its grid cell along the inline axis.
- `center`: Centers the grid item within its grid cell along the inline axis.
- `stretch`: Stretches the grid item to fill the entire width of its grid cell along the inline axis.
- `self-start`: Aligns the grid item to the start of its grid cell along the inline axis (similar to `start` but for the specific item).
- `self-end`: Aligns the grid item to the end of its grid cell along the inline axis (similar to `end` but for the specific item).
- `self-center`: Centers the grid item within its grid cell along the inline axis (similar to `center` but for the specific item).
- `self-stretch`: Stretches the grid item to fill the width of its grid cell along the inline axis (similar to `stretch` but for the specific item).

### **Why Use `justify-self`?**
The `justify-self` property is used to modify the horizontal alignment of a specific grid item within its own grid cell. It's useful when you want to align a particular item differently from the default alignment set by the `justify-items` property on the grid container.

### **Where to Use `justify-self`?**
Use the `justify-self` property on individual grid items within a grid layout when you want to control their horizontal alignment within their own cells along the inline (row) axis.

### **How to Use `justify-self`:**
1. Identify the specific grid item that requires a different horizontal alignment.
2. Apply the `justify-self` property to that grid item, specifying the desired value.

### **Example Values:**
- `justify-self: center;`: Centers the grid item within its own cell along the row axis.
- `justify-self: start;`: Aligns the grid item to the start of its own cell along the row axis.
- `justify-self: end;`: Aligns the grid item to the end of its own cell along the row axis.

### **SEO Considerations:**
The `justify-self` property primarily affects the layout and visual presentation of a web page. It doesn't have a direct impact on SEO.

### **Additional Notes:**
- `justify-self` applies only to the individual grid item and overrides the alignment set by `justify-items` for that specific item.
- It's particularly useful for achieving fine-grained control over the alignment of specific grid items within a layout.

### **Browser Support:**
The `justify-self` property is supported in modern browsers that support CSS Grid Layout.

In summary, the `justify-self` CSS property is used within a Grid Layout context to modify the horizontal alignment of an individual grid item within its own grid cell along the inline (row) axis. It allows you to fine-tune the alignment for specific items within a grid layout.
