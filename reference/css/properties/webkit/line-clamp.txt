The `-webkit-line-clamp` property is a non-standard CSS property used in older versions of WebKit-based browsers (such as Safari) to control the number of lines that should be displayed within a block-level element with overflowing text. It was primarily used to create text truncation effects with a specific number of lines. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, this property is still supported in WebKit-based browsers like Safari, but it's not part of the CSS standard and is not supported in other modern browsers like Chrome or Firefox.

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .text-container {
    display: -webkit-box;
    -webkit-line-clamp: 3; /* Display only 3 lines of text */
    -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
    overflow: hidden;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="text-container">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Why:**
The `-webkit-line-clamp` property was used to create a text truncation effect where text content would be limited to a specific number of lines within an element. It was commonly used to create more visually appealing designs when dealing with limited space.

**Where:**
In the context of its historical usage, the `-webkit-line-clamp` property could be applied to elements with text content that needed to be truncated after a certain number of lines.

**How:**
The `-webkit-line-clamp` property accepted an integer value to specify the maximum number of lines the text should span. It was used in conjunction with `-webkit-box-orient` to set the text orientation and `-webkit-box` for creating the box layout.

**SEO:**
The `-webkit-line-clamp` property and its usage have no direct impact on SEO. However, it's important to consider that truncating text might affect the readability of the content, so use it judiciously.

**Additional Notes:**
- `-webkit-line-clamp` is specific to WebKit-based browsers like Safari and is not part of the CSS standard.
- This property only works with block-level elements and requires `-webkit-box` layout and `-webkit-box-orient` settings.
- While `-webkit-line-clamp` can create text truncation effects, consider responsive design and user experience implications when truncating content.

**Browser Support:**
The `-webkit-line-clamp` property is supported in older versions of WebKit-based browsers like Safari. It's not supported in other modern browsers like Chrome or Firefox. When using this property, consider providing alternative styles for other browsers or using JavaScript-based solutions for broader compatibility.
