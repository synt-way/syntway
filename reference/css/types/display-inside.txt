The term `<display-inside>` is not a standard HTML or CSS element, property, or value. It appears to be a placeholder or an incomplete representation of a CSS concept. However, I can explain the concept of `display` property values in CSS and how they relate to the concept of `display-inside`.

**What is the `display` property in CSS?**
The `display` property in CSS is used to control how an HTML element is rendered on the web page. It defines the type of box an element generates and how it interacts with other elements in the layout. The `display` property can take various values, and one of them is `display-inside`.

**Why is the `display` property used?**
The `display` property is used to control the layout and behavior of HTML elements. Different values of the `display` property can change an element's default behavior, allowing developers to create custom layouts and structures.

**Where is the `display` property used?**
The `display` property is used in CSS to style HTML elements. It's applied to individual elements to specify how they should be rendered in the layout.

**How to use the `display` property with examples (in CSS):**
Here are examples of how to use the `display` property with various values:

1. `display: block;`

```css
/* The element will be a block-level element */
.element {
  display: block;
}
```

2. `display: inline;`

```css
/* The element will be an inline-level element */
.element {
  display: inline;
}
```

3. `display: flex;`

```css
/* The element will become a flex container */
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

4. `display: grid;`

```css
/* The element will become a grid container */
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}
```

5. `display: none;`

```css
/* The element will be hidden (not rendered) */
.hidden-element {
  display: none;
}
```

**SEO implications:**
The use of the `display` property in CSS itself does not have a direct impact on SEO (Search Engine Optimization). SEO primarily involves optimizing content, meta tags, and other factors to improve a website's visibility in search engine results. However, the proper use of the `display` property can contribute to a better user experience, indirectly affecting SEO.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `display` property is a powerful tool for controlling the layout and structure of web pages.
- Understanding the various `display` values is crucial for creating responsive and accessible designs.

**Browser Support:**
Support for the `display` property and its values is universal and well-supported across all modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer. The `display` property is a fundamental part of web layout and design.
