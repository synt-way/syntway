### **What is `list-style-position`?**
The `list-style-position` property in CSS is used to control the positioning of list markers (bullets or numbers) in ordered and unordered lists. It determines whether the markers appear inside or outside the content area of the list items.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `list-style-position` property is as follows:

```

Where `selector` is the target list element, and `value` represents the desired position for the list markers.

```

In the example above, the unordered list (`<ul>`) markers will be positioned outside the content area of the list items.

### **Values of `list-style-position`:**
- `inside`: The list markers are positioned inside the content area of the list items.
- `outside`: The list markers are positioned outside the content area of the list items.

### **Why Use `list-style-position`?**
The `list-style-position` property is used to control the visual positioning of list markers. It determines whether the markers are positioned within the content area of list items or outside of it.

### **Where to Use `list-style-position`?**
Use the `list-style-position` property on unordered (`<ul>`) or ordered (`<ol>`) list elements where you want to control the position of list markers.

### **How to Use `list-style-position`:**
1. Decide whether you want the list markers to appear inside or outside the content area of the list items.
