It seems you're asking about the "is" attribute in web development. However, your question is quite broad, and "is" could refer to different things in different contexts. I'll cover a few possibilities below:

1. **Custom Elements and "is" Attribute:**

**What is the "is" Attribute?**
The "is" attribute is used in conjunction with Custom Elements, a feature of web components, to associate a custom element with a specific built-in HTML element type.

**Why Use the "is" Attribute?**
This allows you to extend the behavior of existing HTML elements while using your own custom element's functionality. It's part of creating more reusable and modular code using web components.

**Where is the "is" Attribute Used?**
The "is" attribute is used when defining a custom element using the `customElements.define()` method.

**How to Use the "is" Attribute?**
Here's an example:

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<my-custom-button is="button">Click me</my-custom-button>
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
class MyCustomButton extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    // Custom element implementation
  }
}

customElements.define('my-custom-button', MyCustomButton, { extends: 'button' });
```

In this example, the "is" attribute associates the custom element `<my-custom-button>` with the built-in `<button>` element.

2. **CSS "is" Attribute:**

**What is the "is" Attribute?**
The "is" attribute can also be used in CSS for applying styles to specific custom elements.

**Why Use the "is" Attribute?**
It's used to apply specific styles to a custom element based on its name or other attribute.

**Where is the "is" Attribute Used?**
In a CSS rule to select custom elements.

**How to Use the "is" Attribute in CSS?**
Here's an example:

```css
/* CSS */
[is="my-custom-button"] {
  /* Styles for custom button */
}
```

3. **SEO and the "is" Attribute:**

As of my last update in September 2021, the "is" attribute in both the Custom Elements context and the CSS context doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. It's primarily a feature that helps with code modularity and styling.

**Additional Notes:**
- The "is" attribute in the Custom Elements context is used to prevent custom element name clashes with future standard HTML elements.
- The CSS "is" attribute is more specific than selecting by tag name alone.

**Browser Support:**
- The "is" attribute used with Custom Elements has good support in modern browsers.
- The CSS "is" attribute has limited browser support and may not work as expected in all browsers.

Please note that developments in web technologies can occur after my last update in September 2021. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about the "is" attribute in specific contexts, consult the latest web standards documentation and browser resources.
