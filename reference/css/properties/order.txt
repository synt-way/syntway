The `order` CSS property is used within flexbox and grid layout models to control the visual order of elements in a container. It allows you to rearrange the order in which elements are displayed on the screen, without altering the HTML structure.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the `order` property using the provided template:

### **What is `order`?**
The `order` property in CSS is used to control the visual order of flex items or grid items within their containers. It lets you change the display order without changing the actual HTML structure.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `order` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  order: number;
}
```

Where `selector` is the target element, and `number` represents the order value. Elements with lower order values are displayed first, followed by elements with higher order values.

### **Example:**
```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
}

.flex-item {
  order: 2;
}
```

In the example above, the `.flex-item` with an `order` value of 2 will be displayed after other flex items within the `.flex-container`.

### **Values of `order`:**
- `number`: An integer value that determines the order of the element within its container. Elements with lower numbers appear first.

### **Why Use `order`?**
The `order` property is useful for rearranging the visual order of elements within flex containers or grid layouts. It's particularly handy for responsive designs where you need to change the order of elements based on screen sizes or user interactions.

### **Where to Use `order`?**
Use the `order` property within flex containers or grid layouts to control the order of specific items.

### **How to Use `order`:**
1. Determine the desired order value for the element.
2. Apply the `order` property to the target element.

### **Example Values:**
- `order: 0;`: The default order. The element appears in the order it appears in the HTML.
- `order: -1;`: The element will be displayed before elements with an order of 0 or higher.
- `order: 2;`: The element will be displayed after elements with an order of 0 or 1.

### **SEO Considerations:**
The `order` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. It's primarily used for layout and visual organization.

### **Additional Notes:**
- The `order` property doesn't change the underlying document order; it only affects the visual order.
- Combining `order` with media queries allows for responsive reordering of elements.
- When using `order`, be cautious about creating unintuitive or confusing layouts.

### **Browser Support:**
The `order` property is supported in modern browsers that support the flexbox and grid layout models. Browser compatibility is generally good, making it a reliable choice for layout adjustments.
