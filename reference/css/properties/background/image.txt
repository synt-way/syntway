The `background-image` property in CSS is used to set one or more background images for an element. It allows you to add visual elements to the background of an element, such as images, gradients, or patterns.

**Example:**
```css
.header {
  background-image: url('background.jpg'); /* Set a background image */
}
```

**Why:**
The `background-image` property is used to enhance the visual appearance of an element by adding visual elements to its background. It's commonly used to add images, patterns, or gradients to elements to make them visually engaging.

**Where:**
Apply the `background-image` property to elements where you want to add visual content to the background, such as divs, sections, and headers.

**How:**
Set the value of the `background-image` property to the URL of the image you want to use as the background. You can also use other values like gradients or patterns, defined using CSS syntax.

**SEO:**
The `background-image` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, using it to create visually appealing designs can contribute to a better user experience, which indirectly affects user engagement and retention.

**Additional Notes:**
- You can use multiple background images by separating them with commas.
- You can control the behavior of background images using properties like `background-repeat`, `background-size`, and `background-position`.
- Background images are typically used for decorative purposes and should not contain critical content.

**Browser Support:**
The `background-image` property is widely supported in all modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It provides consistent behavior across these browsers.
