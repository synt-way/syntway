The term `<display-listitem>` is not a standard HTML or CSS element, property, or value. It appears to be a placeholder or an incomplete representation of a CSS concept. However, I can explain the concept of CSS list items and how they are typically styled using the `display` property.

**What are CSS List Items?**
In HTML, lists are structured using `<ul>` (unordered lists) and `<ol>` (ordered lists) elements. List items are represented using `<li>` elements. These list items can be styled and formatted using CSS to create various types of lists, such as bullet lists, numbered lists, or custom-styled lists.

**Why are CSS List Items Styled?**
List items are styled to improve the visual presentation of lists on a webpage. Developers often want to customize the appearance of list items to match the design of their website or to convey information effectively.

**Where are CSS List Items Styled?**
CSS styles for list items are applied within the CSS stylesheet associated with an HTML document. The styles can be applied globally or selectively to specific lists or list items.

**How to Style List Items with Examples (in CSS):**
Here are examples of how to style list items in CSS:

1. Removing Bullets from Unordered Lists:

```css
/* Remove bullets from unordered lists */
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
}
```

2. Customizing Ordered List Numbers:

```css
/* Customize the numbering of ordered lists */
ol {
  list-style-type: upper-roman;
}
```

3. Adding Custom Styles to List Items:

```css
/* Add custom styles to list items */
li {
  color: #333;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

**SEO Implications:**
The styling of list items itself does not have a significant impact on SEO (Search Engine Optimization). SEO primarily involves optimizing content, meta tags, and other factors to improve a website's visibility in search engine results. However, clear and well-structured lists can enhance the readability and user experience of web content, indirectly contributing to SEO.

**Additional Notes:**
- Lists are a fundamental part of HTML content and are used to organize and present information in a structured manner.
- CSS provides extensive flexibility in styling list items, including changing bullet styles, numbering formats, fonts, and colors.

**Browser Support:**
Support for styling list items using CSS is universal and well-supported across all modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer. CSS offers robust tools for customizing the appearance of list items.
