As of my last update in September 2021, the property `border-inline-start-color` is not a standard CSS property. However, if you're trying to achieve a custom border-like effect on the start (beginning) side of an inline element, you can use pseudo-elements like `::before` and style them using standard properties.

Here's an example:

```css
/* Apply a custom border-like effect at the start of an inline element */
.inline-start-border::before {
  content: "";
  display: inline-block;
  width: 10px;
  height: 2px;
  background-color: blue; /* Set the desired color */
  margin-right: 5px; /* Adjust as needed */
}
```

In this example, the `::before` pseudo-element is used to create a blue horizontal line at the start of the inline element with the class `.inline-start-border`.

Please remember that CSS capabilities can evolve, and new features might have been introduced after September 2021. Always refer to the latest CSS specifications or resources like MDN Web Docs for accurate and up-to-date information.
