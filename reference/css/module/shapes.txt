**CSS Shapes**

**What:**
CSS Shapes refer to the ability to define non-rectangular shapes for elements, allowing content to flow around or within those shapes. This feature is commonly used to create visually appealing designs, text wraps, and unique layout effects.

**Example:**
Here's an example of using CSS Shapes to wrap text around a circular shape:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .circle {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: lightblue;
    shape-outside: circle();
    float: left;
    margin: 20px 20px 20px 0;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="circle"></div>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Quisque sit amet finibus odio.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

**Why:**
CSS Shapes allow you to create unique layouts and designs that go beyond traditional rectangular elements. They can enhance visual appeal and create more engaging and dynamic content.

**Where:**
CSS Shapes are applicable whenever you want to:
- Wrap text around images or elements of different shapes.
- Create custom layouts with non-rectangular elements.
- Enhance the design and aesthetics of your website.

**How:**
Use the `shape-outside` property to define the shape, and use functions like `circle()`, `ellipse()`, `polygon()`, and `inset()` to specify the shape's dimensions.

**SEO:**
CSS Shapes themselves don't have a direct impact on SEO. However, they can contribute to a better user experience by enhancing the visual appeal of your content, which might indirectly influence user engagement and SEO.

**Additional Notes:**
- Not all browsers support all shape functions or might have slightly different behavior.
- Be aware that CSS Shapes can sometimes affect the layout, especially in responsive designs.

**Browser Support:**
CSS Shapes are supported by modern browsers, but the level of support might vary for specific shape functions. Always test your shapes across different browsers to ensure consistent rendering.
