The `:focus-visible` pseudo-class in CSS is used to select and style elements that are currently in focus, but it only applies the styles when the focus is visible and likely to be of interest to the user. It is particularly useful for enhancing the accessibility and user experience of web forms and interactive elements.

**Syntax:**
```css
selector:focus-visible {
    /* CSS rules for elements in visible focus */
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class:

1. **What is the `:focus-visible` Pseudo-Class in CSS?**
   - The `:focus-visible` pseudo-class selects and styles elements that are currently in focus and where the focus is visible and relevant to the user. It is typically used to style form elements and interactive elements to improve accessibility.

2. **Why Use the `:focus-visible` Pseudo-Class?**
   - You use the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class to provide a visual indication of focus on elements that are interactive and require user input. It helps users, especially those who navigate using keyboard or assistive technologies, understand which element is currently focused.

3. **Where Can You Use the `:focus-visible` Pseudo-Class?**
   - You can use it in your CSS stylesheets to target and style interactive elements that should be visually highlighted when in focus, such as buttons, links, input fields, and other focusable elements.

4. **How to Use the `:focus-visible` Pseudo-Class?**
   - To use it, select the element you want to style, followed by `:focus-visible`. Define the CSS rules inside the curly braces `{}` that follow. These rules will apply when the element is in visible focus.

   ```css
   button:focus-visible {
       outline: 2px solid #0077FF; /* Add a visible outline when the button is in focus */
   }
   ```

5. **SEO Considerations:**
   - The `:focus-visible` pseudo-class itself does not have a direct impact on SEO. SEO primarily focuses on the content and structure of HTML documents, rather than the styling applied to elements.

6. **Additional Notes:**
   - The `:focus-visible` pseudo-class is particularly important for web accessibility. It ensures that focus styles are applied only when the focus is likely to be helpful to the user, preventing unnecessary or disruptive focus styles in certain cases.
   - The behavior of the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class can vary between browsers, and its support may depend on browser settings. Therefore, it's important to test and verify its behavior in different browsers.

7. **Browser Support:**
   - Browser support for the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class has been improving, but it may still vary between browsers. It is widely supported in modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. However, older browsers may not fully support it.

Here's an example of how you might use the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class in a CSS stylesheet to add a visible outline to a button when it gains focus, improving the accessibility of the button:

```css
/* Add a visible outline to the button when in visible focus */
button:focus-visible {
    outline: 2px solid #0077FF;
}
```

In this example, when a user interacts with the button and it gains visible focus (e.g., by clicking on it or tabbing to it), it will have a blue outline, providing clear visual feedback about the focused state of the button.
