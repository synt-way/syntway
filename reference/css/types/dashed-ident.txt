The term `<dashed-ident>` is not a standard HTML or CSS element, property, or value. It appears to be a placeholder or an incomplete representation of a CSS concept. However, I can provide an explanation of CSS identifiers and how dashes (hyphens) are commonly used in naming conventions.

**What are CSS Identifiers and Dashed Identifiers?**
- In CSS, an identifier is a name given to a CSS rule, class, ID, custom property, or variable. Identifiers can include letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.
- A dashed identifier, often referred to as a "kebab-case" identifier, is an identifier that uses hyphens to separate words. For example, `my-class-name` or `custom-property-name`.

**Why are Dashed Identifiers Used?**
- Dashed identifiers are used for readability and to follow best practices for naming in web development.
- They are commonly used for naming CSS classes, custom properties (variables), and other identifiers to make the names more human-readable and to improve code maintainability.

**Where are Dashed Identifiers Used?**
- Dashed identifiers are used in CSS for:
  - Naming CSS classes: `<div class="my-class-name">`
  - Defining custom properties (variables): `--primary-color: blue;`
  - Creating URLs in CSS (e.g., for background images): `background-image: url('my-image.jpg');`
  - Naming files and directories in web development (e.g., in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and URLs).

**How to Use Dashed Identifiers (Examples in CSS):**
Here are some examples of dashed identifiers in CSS:

1. Naming a CSS class:

```css
/* Dashed identifier for a CSS class */
.my-class-name {
  /* CSS rules here */
}
```

2. Defining a custom property with a dashed identifier:

```css
/* Dashed identifier for a custom property (variable) */
:root {
  --primary-color: blue;
}
```

3. Using a dashed identifier in a URL:

```css
/* Using a dashed identifier in a URL for a background image */
.element {
  background-image: url('my-background-image.jpg');
}
```

**SEO Implications:**
The use of dashed identifiers itself does not have a direct impact on SEO (Search Engine Optimization). SEO primarily involves optimizing content, meta tags, and other factors to improve a website's visibility in search engine results. However, using well-named and human-readable identifiers, including dashed identifiers, can indirectly contribute to code maintainability and developer productivity, which can positively affect the overall quality of a website.

**Additional Notes:**
- Dashed identifiers are also known as "kebab-case" identifiers, and they are a common naming convention in web development.
- When naming files and directories for a web project, it's a good practice to use dashed identifiers for consistency and readability in URLs.

**Browser Support:**
Dashed identifiers are a widely accepted naming convention in web development and are supported by all modern web browsers. They are a best practice for creating readable and maintainable code.
