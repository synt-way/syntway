The `counter-reset` CSS property is used to reset the value of a counter that is created using the `counter-increment` property. Counters are often used in combination with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to generate automatic numbering or labeling of content.

Here's an in-depth explanation of the `counter-reset` property using the provided template:

### **What is `counter-reset`?**
The `counter-reset` property is used to reset the value of a counter that has been created using the `counter-increment` property. Counters are used to generate automatic numbering or labeling for content elements in a structured manner.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using `counter-reset` is as follows:

```css
selector {
  counter-reset: counter-name value;
}
```

Where:
- `selector` is the target element.
- `counter-name` is the name of the counter you want to reset.
- `value` is the value to which the counter should be reset.

### **Example:**
Let's say you want to create a numbered list that starts from a specific number:

```css
ol {
  counter-reset: my-counter 5;
}

li {
  counter-increment: my-counter;
  list-style: none;
}

li::before {
  content: counter(my-counter) ". ";
}
```

### **Why Use `counter-reset`?**
`counter-reset` is used when you want to set the initial value of a counter, which is then incremented or decremented using the `counter-increment` property. This is helpful for generating ordered or labeled content, such as numbered lists or chapter headings.

### **Where to Use `counter-reset`?**
Use `counter-reset` on elements where you want to reset the value of a counter, typically before a new sequence of numbered or labeled content.

### **How to Use `counter-reset`:**
1. Use `counter-reset` to set the initial value of a counter.
2. Apply `counter-increment` to the desired elements to increment or decrement the counter's value.
3. Use the `counter()` function with the `::before` or `::after` pseudo-element to display the counter value.

### **SEO Considerations:**
Using counters and automatic numbering can enhance the readability and structure of your content, which indirectly contributes to SEO by improving user experience.

### **Additional Notes:**
- **Multiple Counters**: You can use multiple counters with different names to create different numbering sequences.
- **Nested Counters**: You can nest counters to create complex numbering schemes for nested content structures.

### **Browser Support:**
The `counter-reset` property is supported in most modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

In summary, `counter-reset` is a CSS property used to reset the value of counters, which are used to generate automatic numbering or labeling of content elements. It's commonly used in conjunction with `counter-increment` to create structured and styled lists or headings.
