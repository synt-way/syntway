The `:checked` pseudo-class in CSS is used to select and style form elements, primarily checkboxes and radio buttons, that have been checked or selected by the user. This pseudo-class is particularly useful for creating custom styles for checked input elements and enhancing user interface design.

**Syntax:**
```css
input[type="checkbox"]:checked {
    /* CSS rules for checked checkboxes */
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the `:checked` pseudo-class:

1. **What is the `:checked` Pseudo-Class in CSS?**
   - The `:checked` pseudo-class is used to target and style form elements that have been checked or selected by the user. It is commonly used with checkboxes and radio buttons.

2. **Why Use the `:checked` Pseudo-Class?**
   - You use the `:checked` pseudo-class to provide visual feedback to users when they interact with checkboxes and radio buttons. It allows you to change the appearance of these form elements when they are selected.

3. **Where Can You Use the `:checked` Pseudo-Class?**
   - You can use it in your CSS stylesheets to target and style checkboxes and radio buttons. This pseudo-class is especially useful when you want to create custom styles for these form elements based on their checked state.

4. **How to Use the `:checked` Pseudo-Class?**
   - To use it, select the form element (usually checkboxes or radio buttons) followed by `:checked`. Define the CSS rules inside the curly braces `{}` that follow. These rules will apply when the element is checked.

   ```css
   input[type="checkbox"]:checked {
       background-color: #00FF00; /* Green background color for checked checkboxes */
   }
   ```

5. **SEO Considerations:**
   - The `:checked` pseudo-class itself does not have a direct impact on SEO. SEO primarily focuses on the content and structure of HTML documents rather than the styling applied to form elements.

6. **Additional Notes:**
   - You can use the `:checked` pseudo-class to create custom styles for checked checkboxes, radio buttons, and sometimes select dropdowns (for their selected options).
   - This pseudo-class can also be used in combination with the adjacent sibling combinator (`+`) to style elements that follow checked checkboxes, enabling you to create interactive interfaces.
   - Browser support for the `:checked` pseudo-class is excellent and widely supported in modern web browsers.

7. **Browser Support:**
   - The `:checked` pseudo-class is widely supported in modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It is a core part of the CSS specification and is compatible with older browser versions as well.

Here's an example of how you might use the `:checked` pseudo-class in a CSS stylesheet to style checked checkboxes:

```css
/* Style checked checkboxes with a green background */
input[type="checkbox"]:checked {
    background-color: #00FF00;
}
```

In this example, when a user checks a checkbox, it will have a green background color to provide visual feedback that it has been selected.
