**CSS Overflow**

**What:**
CSS `overflow` is a property that controls how content that overflows the boundaries of an element's box is displayed. It determines whether scrollbars should appear, content should be clipped, or other behaviors should be applied.

**Example:**
Here's an example of using CSS `overflow` to control the overflow behavior of a div element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .overflow-example {
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    overflow: auto;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="overflow-example">
  This is some content that exceeds the dimensions of the box.
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Why:**
CSS `overflow` is used to handle content that doesn't fit within the dimensions of its containing element. It allows you to decide how this overflowing content should be displayed, whether by scrolling, clipping, or other methods.

**Where:**
CSS `overflow` is applicable when dealing with elements that might have content that exceeds their boundaries, such as containers for text, images, or other content.

**How:**
Use values like `visible`, `hidden`, `scroll`, or `auto` for the `overflow` property to control the overflow behavior of the element.

**SEO:**
CSS `overflow` doesn't directly impact SEO. However, it can affect user experience. Well-managed overflow behavior can make your content more accessible and user-friendly, which might indirectly contribute to SEO.

**Additional Notes:**
- Be cautious with using `overflow: auto;` as it might lead to unexpected behavior on certain screen sizes or devices.
- Overflow behavior can be controlled for both the horizontal and vertical directions.
- Combining `overflow: hidden;` with CSS `text-overflow: ellipsis;` can be used to truncate text that overflows its container.

**Browser Support:**
CSS `overflow` is supported by all modern browsers. However, some older versions of Internet Explorer might have limited or inconsistent support for specific values like `hidden` and `scroll`. Always test your overflow styles across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
