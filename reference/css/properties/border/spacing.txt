Certainly, I'd be glad to explain the `border-spacing` property in CSS:

**What is `border-spacing`?**
`border-spacing` is a CSS property that controls the space between adjacent cells of a table. It's used to set the spacing between the borders of table cells.

**Why is `border-spacing` used?**
`border-spacing` is used to adjust the spacing between the borders of adjacent cells in a table. This can help create a visually pleasing layout and improve the readability of tabular data.

**How to use `border-spacing`?**
The syntax is as follows:

```css
table {
  border-spacing: horizontal vertical;
}
```

Replace `horizontal` with the desired horizontal spacing value and `vertical` with the desired vertical spacing value. These values can be in pixels, percentages, or other length units.

Here's an example:

```css
/* Apply spacing between table cells */
table {
  border-collapse: separate; /* Ensure cells have independent spacing */
  border-spacing: 10px 5px; /* Horizontal and vertical spacing */
}
```

**Where to use `border-spacing`?**
This property is used within your CSS styles and is applicable to HTML table elements.

**SEO Implications:**
The `border-spacing` property itself doesn't have direct SEO implications. SEO primarily focuses on content, keywords, page structure, and meta information.

**Additional Notes:**
- `border-spacing` is often used in combination with the `border-collapse` property, which determines whether table borders should be collapsed into a single border or separated by the spacing.
- It affects the spacing between cell borders, not the content within the cells.

**Browser Support:**
As of my last update in September 2021, `border-spacing` is widely supported in modern browsers. However, always consider checking the latest browser compatibility information on websites like MDN Web Docs or Can I use.

I hope this comprehensive explanation clarifies the usage and importance of the `border-spacing` property. If you have more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
