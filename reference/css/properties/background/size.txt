The `background-size` property in CSS is used to control the size of a background image within an element's content box. It determines how the background image is scaled or displayed in relation to the element's dimensions.

**Example:**
```css
.cover-background {
  background-image: url('image.jpg');
  background-size: cover; /* Scale the background image to cover the entire content box */
}
```

**Why:**
The `background-size` property is used to control how a background image is sized and displayed. It's useful for achieving specific visual effects or maintaining the aspect ratio of the image.

**Where:**
Apply the `background-size` property to elements with background images where you want to control the size and scaling of those images.

**How:**
The `background-size` property accepts values that define how the background image is sized:
- `auto`: The background image is displayed at its natural size.
- `cover`: The background image is scaled to cover the entire content box, potentially cropping parts of the image.
- `contain`: The background image is scaled to fit within the content box, maintaining its aspect ratio.

You can also use length values, percentages, or combinations to specify custom dimensions.

**SEO:**
The `background-size` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, using it to enhance the visual design of your website can contribute to a better user experience.

**Additional Notes:**
- The default value is `auto`.
- The `background-size` property is often used in conjunction with other background properties like `background-image`, `background-repeat`, and `background-position`.

**Browser Support:**
The `background-size` property is widely supported in modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. However, some older versions of Internet Explorer may have limited or no support for certain values like `cover` and `contain`. It's recommended to test across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
