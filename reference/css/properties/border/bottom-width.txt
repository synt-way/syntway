Certainly! Here's an explanation of the CSS property `border-bottom-width`:

**`border-bottom-width` Property:**

The `border-bottom-width` property in CSS is used to define the width of the bottom border of an element.

**Example:**
```css
.container {
  border-bottom: 2px solid #333; /* Set a solid 2px bottom border with color #333 */
}
```

The `border-bottom-width` property allows you to control the width of the bottom border of an element. This helps you customize the thickness of the border to achieve the desired design.

**Where:**
Apply the `border-bottom-width` property to any element where you want to set or modify the width of the bottom border.

**How:**
Set the value of the `border-bottom-width` property to the desired width. This value can be in pixels (`px`), percentages (`%`), or other valid length units.

**SEO:**
The `border-bottom-width` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, using it to create visually appealing designs can contribute to a better user experience, indirectly affecting SEO metrics.

**Additional Notes:**
- This property is often used in combination with other border-related properties like `border-bottom-style` and `border-bottom-color`.
- If you're using the shorthand `border-bottom` property to set multiple border properties at once, the width will be set as well if you include the width value.
