The `image-orientation` CSS property was proposed as part of the CSS Images Module Level 4, but as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, it was not widely supported by browsers and might not be available in many browsing environments.

The `image-orientation` property aimed to control the orientation of images, allowing you to specify whether an image should be displayed in its default orientation or flipped/mirrored horizontally or vertically.

Here's a general explanation of the `image-orientation` property, even though its browser support might have changed since my last update:

### **What is `image-orientation`?**
The `image-orientation` CSS property was intended to control the orientation of images, specifying whether they should be displayed in their default orientation or flipped/mirrored.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `image-orientation` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  image-orientation: from-image | <angle>;
}
```

Where `selector` is the target image element, and the values represent different orientations.

- `from-image`: Uses the image's intrinsic orientation, if specified.
- `<angle>`: Specifies a rotation angle (in degrees) for the image.

### **Example:**
```css
img {
  image-orientation: flip;
}
```

In the example above, the `img` element would be flipped or mirrored.

### **Why Use `image-orientation`?**
The `image-orientation` property would have been used to control the orientation of images, especially when dealing with images that are displayed in a different orientation than intended.

### **Where to Use `image-orientation`?**
Use the `image-orientation` property on image elements where you need to adjust their orientation.

### **Additional Notes:**
- The `image-orientation` property was still a working draft and not widely supported in browsers as of September 2021.
- Always check the most recent browser documentation to confirm if there have been any updates in terms of browser support for this property.

Please verify the current browser support for the `image-orientation` property before attempting to use it in your projects.
