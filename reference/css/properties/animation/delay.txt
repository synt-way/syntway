The `animation-delay` property in CSS is used to specify a delay before an animation starts. It allows you to control when an animation begins after the element becomes active or matches a certain condition. This property is part of the CSS Animations module and provides greater control over the timing of animations.

**Example:**
```css
.slide-in {
  animation: slide 1s ease-in-out 1s; /* Animation with a 1-second delay */
}

@keyframes slide {
  from { transform: translateX(-100%); }
  to { transform: translateX(0); }
}
```

**Why:**
The `animation-delay` property is used when you want to introduce a delay before an animation starts. It's particularly useful for creating sequential animations or ensuring that animations start at specific times in response to user interactions.

**Where:**
Apply the `animation-delay` property to the element you're animating to introduce a delay before the animation begins.

**How:**
The `animation-delay` property accepts a time value (in seconds or milliseconds) that determines the delay before the animation starts after the element becomes active.

**SEO:**
The `animation-delay` property and animations themselves don't have a direct impact on SEO. However, using animations thoughtfully can enhance user experience and engagement.

**Additional Notes:**
- You can combine `animation-delay` with other animation properties like `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, and `animation-timing-function` to create more complex animations.
- Animations with delays can be used to create a staggered appearance of elements or to synchronize animations with user actions.
- Ensure that the delay time matches your design intent and user expectations.

**Browser Support:**
The `animation-delay` property is supported in modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It is widely supported and provides consistent behavior across these browsers.
