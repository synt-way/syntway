As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the `<strike>` element is an HTML element that represents struck-through or deleted text. It is used to indicate that the enclosed text has been deleted or marked as irrelevant. However, please note that the `<strike>` element has been deprecated in favor of using CSS for text decoration.

Here's a detailed explanation of the `<strike>` element, addressing your requested topics:

**1. What is the `<strike>` Element?**
