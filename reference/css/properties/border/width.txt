Absolutely, let's delve into a comprehensive explanation of the `border-width` property in CSS:

**What is `border-width`?**
The `border-width` property in CSS is used to set the widths of all four borders of an element (top, right, bottom, and left) in a single declaration.

**Why is `border-width` used?**
`border-width` is used to control the thickness or width of all borders of an element simultaneously, ensuring consistent border thickness around all sides.

**How to use `border-width`?**
The syntax is simple:

```css
element {
  border-width: top right bottom left;
}
```

Replace `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` with the desired width values. These values can be in pixels (px), percentages (%), em, or other length units.

Here's an example:

```css
/* Apply different border widths to all sides of an element */
.element {
  border-width: 2px 1px 3px 1px; /* top right bottom left */
  border-style: solid; /* Define border style */
  border-color: red; /* Define border color */
}
```

**Where to use `border-width`?**
This property is used within your CSS styles and can be applied whenever you need to adjust the widths of all borders of an element.

**SEO Implications:**
The `border-width` property itself doesn't have direct SEO implications. SEO primarily focuses on content, keywords, page structure, and meta information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `border-width` property is often used in conjunction with other border-related properties like `border-style` and `border-color`.
- By setting different widths, you can control the prominence of each border side.

**Browser Support:**
As of my last update in September 2021, `border-width` is widely supported in modern browsers. However, always consider checking the latest browser compatibility information on sites like MDN Web Docs or Can I use.
