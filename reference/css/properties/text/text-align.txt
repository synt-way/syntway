It seems like you're asking about the CSS property `text-align` and its various aspects. Let's break down your questions:

**What is `text-align`?**
`text-align` is a CSS property used to control the horizontal alignment of text within an element. It specifies how the text content of an element should be aligned within its containing box.

**Why is `text-align` used?**
`text-align` is used to control the visual presentation of text on a web page. It allows you to align text to the left, right, center, justify, or to a specific position within an element, depending on your design requirements.

**Where is `text-align` applied?**
You can apply the `text-align` property to various HTML elements that contain text content, such as `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<div>`, and more. It can also be applied to inline elements like `<span>` if they are used to contain text.

**How to use `text-align` with examples:**
Here are some examples of how to use `text-align`:

1. Left-align text:
   ```css
   .left-align {
     text-align: left;
   }
   ```

2. Center-align text:
   ```css
   .center-align {
     text-align: center;
   }
   ```

3. Right-align text:
   ```css
   .right-align {
     text-align: right;
   }
   ```

4. Justify text (aligns text to both the left and right edges):
   ```css
   .justify {
     text-align: justify;
   }
   ```

5. Align text to a specific position (e.g., 50% from the left):
   ```css
   .custom-align {
     text-align: 50%;
   }
   ```

**SEO implications:**
The `text-align` property itself does not have a direct impact on SEO (Search Engine Optimization). SEO primarily involves optimizing content, meta tags, and other factors to improve a website's visibility in search engine results. However, proper text alignment can improve the readability and user experience of your content, indirectly affecting SEO.

**Additional Notes:**
- `text-align` can be overridden by more specific CSS selectors or inline styles.
- It applies to both text and inline-level elements within the targeted element.
- It can also be inherited by child elements, but they can override it with their own `text-align` property.

**Browser Support:**
`text-align` is supported by all modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11. It has been a part of the CSS standard for a long time and is widely used in web development. However, it's always a good practice to check the current browser compatibility when working on a web project, as support for specific features can vary slightly.
