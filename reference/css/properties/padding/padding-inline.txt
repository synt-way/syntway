As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there isn't a CSS property called `padding-inline`. However, it's possible that such a property or something similar has been introduced in more recent versions of CSS. To provide accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the latest CSS specifications, resources like MDN Web Docs, or official CSS Working Group documentation.

If `padding-inline` or a similar property exists, these general principles will still apply:

1. **What is `padding-inline`**:
   - If it exists, `padding-inline` would likely be a CSS property used to control the padding (space) between an element's content and its borders in the inline (horizontal) direction. It would affect the left and right sides of an element in LTR (left-to-right) writing modes.

2. **Why Use `padding-inline`**:
   - Such a property would be used to adjust the spacing between an element's content and its borders along the inline axis, allowing for better control over the layout and presentation of elements.

3. **Where to Apply `padding-inline`**:
   - It would be applied to HTML elements where you need to control the padding along the inline axis, such as `<div>`, `<section>`, or other containers.

4. **How to Use `padding-inline`**:
   - The usage would likely follow the standard CSS syntax:
   
     ```css
     element {
       padding-inline: value;
     }
     ```

     Replace `element` with the selector for the HTML element you want to style, and `value` with the desired padding value, specified in pixels (`px`), percentages (`%`), ems (`em`), or other supported units.

5. **SEO Implications**:
   - The `padding-inline` property, like other CSS properties related to layout and spacing, would not have direct SEO implications. Its primary role would be in styling and layout, which can indirectly impact user experience and engagement.

6. **Additional Notes**:
   - If introduced, `padding-inline` might be used in combination with other padding-related properties, such as `padding-block` (for vertical padding), to control spacing on both axes.
   - The specific behavior and usage would depend on the CSS specification and browser support at the time.

7. **Browser Support**:
   - The level of browser support for `padding-inline` or similar properties would depend on when it was introduced and its adoption by major web browsers. Always check for the latest compatibility information when working with new CSS properties.
