The `pointer-events` CSS property allows you to control how an element responds to pointer events (like clicks, taps, and mouse interactions). It can be used to make an element non-interactive, effectively preventing it from receiving or responding to pointer events. Here's a detailed explanation of `pointer-events`:

1. **What is `pointer-events`**:
   - `pointer-events` is a CSS property used to control how an HTML element responds to pointer events, such as clicks, taps, hover, and dragging.

2. **Why Use `pointer-events`**:
   - You use `pointer-events` to control the interactivity of an element. This is particularly useful when you want to make an element non-clickable or non-interactive without removing it from the layout.
   - It can help prevent accidental clicks on elements, disable interactions during specific states (e.g., during animations), or allow pointer events to "pass through" an element to interact with elements below it.

3. **Where to Apply `pointer-events`**:
   - You can apply `pointer-events` to any HTML element that you want to control in terms of pointer event behavior.

4. **How to Use `pointer-events`**:
   - You can use `pointer-events` in your CSS stylesheet using the following syntax:
   
     ```css
     element {
       pointer-events: value;
     }
     ```
   
     Replace `element` with the selector for the HTML element you want to style and `value` with one of the following values:
     
     - `auto`: Default value. The element responds to pointer events as usual.
     - `none`: The element doesn't respond to any pointer events, effectively making it non-interactive.
     - `visiblePainted`: The element doesn't respond to pointer events that would target its background.
     - `visibleFill`: The element doesn't respond to pointer events that would target its interior fill.
     - `visibleStroke`: The element doesn't respond to pointer events that would target its border stroke.
     - `visible`: The element doesn't respond to pointer events targeting any of its parts.

5. **SEO Implications**:
   - `pointer-events` primarily affects the interactivity of web elements. It doesn't have direct SEO implications, as SEO focuses on content accessibility, quality, and search engine ranking.

6. **Additional Notes**:
   - Be cautious when using `pointer-events: none`, as it can make content inaccessible or confusing for users if used indiscriminately.
   - `pointer-events` can be used creatively to create interactive effects, like tooltips that appear when hovering over an element but don't interfere with underlying content.
   - It's important to consider accessibility when using `pointer-events` to ensure that interactive elements are still usable for all users, including those with disabilities.

7. **Browser Support**:
   - `pointer-events` is supported in modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera. However, browser support for this property may vary for older versions of browsers, so it's essential to test your code across different browsers if compatibility is a concern.

Here's an example of how to use `pointer-events` in CSS:

```css
.button {
  pointer-events: none;
  background-color: #3498db;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  cursor: not-allowed;
}
```

In this example, the `.button` element has `pointer-events: none`, making it non-interactive. It also changes the cursor to "not-allowed" to indicate to users that the button cannot be clicked or interacted with.
