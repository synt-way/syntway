The `-webkit-text-stroke-color` property is a non-standard CSS property used in older versions of WebKit-based browsers (such as Safari) to specify the color of the stroke applied to the text characters within an element using the `-webkit-text-stroke` property. This property allows developers to set the color of the stroke that outlines the text. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, this property is still supported in WebKit-based browsers like Safari, but it's not part of the CSS standard and is not supported in other modern browsers like Chrome or Firefox.

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .outlined-text {
    -webkit-text-stroke: 2px; /* Set the stroke width */
    -webkit-text-stroke-color: red; /* Set the stroke color */
    color: white; /* Set the text color */
    font-size: 24px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p class="outlined-text">
  This text has a red outline.
</p>

</body>
</html>
```

**Why:**
The `-webkit-text-stroke-color` property is used to specify the color of the stroke applied to the text characters within an element. This helps in creating outlined or bordered text effects, improving text visibility and emphasizing the text against different backgrounds.

**Where:**
In the context of its historical usage, the `-webkit-text-stroke-color` property can be applied to elements containing text content where a specific color for the stroke outline is desired.

**How:**
The `-webkit-text-stroke-color` property accepts color values, such as hexadecimal or RGB values, to specify the color of the stroke applied to the text.

**SEO:**
The `-webkit-text-stroke-color` property and its usage have no direct impact on SEO, as it's primarily a styling property that affects the visual appearance of text content.

**Additional Notes:**
- `-webkit-text-stroke-color` is specific to WebKit-based browsers like Safari and is not part of the CSS standard.
- When using this property, it's important to consider the contrast between the text color and the stroke color for optimal readability.

**Browser Support:**
The `-webkit-text-stroke-color` property is supported in older versions of WebKit-based browsers like Safari. It's not supported in other modern browsers like Chrome or Firefox. When using this property, consider providing alternative styles for other browsers or using other techniques for broader compatibility.
