The `-webkit-box-reflect` property was a non-standard CSS property used in older versions of WebKit-based browsers (such as Safari and Chrome) to create reflections of elements, particularly for use in styling elements like images and text. It allowed developers to apply a visual reflection effect to an element, giving the appearance of a mirrored reflection below the element. However, as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, this property is deprecated and not recommended for use in modern browsers, including recent versions of Safari and Chrome.

Given that this property is obsolete and not widely supported, I'll provide an example and explanation of how it used to work:

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .reflected-image {
    -webkit-box-reflect: below 0; /* Apply reflection effect below the image */
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" class="reflected-image">

</body>
</html>
```

**Why:**
The `-webkit-box-reflect` property was used to create a reflection effect below elements like images or text. It was often used to add a visual flair to website elements.

**Where:**
In the context of its historical usage, the `-webkit-box-reflect` property could be applied to elements like images or text to create a reflection effect.

**How:**
The `-webkit-box-reflect` property accepted values like `above`, `below`, `left`, and `right`, along with an offset value to control the size and position of the reflection.

**SEO:**
The `-webkit-box-reflect` property and its usage have no direct impact on SEO, as it was a browser-specific and non-standard feature related to styling.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `-webkit-box-reflect` property was specific to WebKit-based browsers (e.g., Safari and Chrome) and was not part of the CSS standard.
- Modern browsers, including newer versions of Safari and Chrome, no longer support this property.
- For adding visual effects, consider using standard CSS properties like gradients, shadows, and filters.

**Browser Support:**
The `-webkit-box-reflect` property was supported only in older versions of WebKit-based browsers. It is no longer supported in modern browsers. If you want to create reflection effects, explore other CSS techniques that are supported by a wider range of browsers.
