As of my last update in September 2021, the "inert" attribute is not a standard HTML attribute, but rather a concept proposed as a part of the HTML Living Standard. The "inert" attribute is intended to create a mechanism for making certain elements in a web page non-interactive and unselectable.

**What is the "inert" Attribute (Concept)?**
The "inert" attribute, as a concept, would allow developers to apply the "inert" state to specific elements in a web page's DOM (Document Object Model). Elements in the "inert" state would be essentially "disabled" in terms of user interaction, preventing them from receiving focus, clicks, and other interactions.

**Why Use the "inert" Attribute?**
The primary purpose of the "inert" attribute concept is to improve the user experience by reducing confusion and unwanted interactions when certain parts of a web page should be temporarily non-interactive. This can be useful when showing modal dialogs, overlays, or other situations where interactions with the underlying content need to be prevented.

**Where Would the "inert" Attribute Be Used?**
The "inert" attribute would be used on HTML elements where you want to make them non-interactive temporarily while other content or overlays are active.

**How Would the "inert" Attribute Be Used?**
As of my last update, the "inert" attribute is still in the proposal stage and not yet a standard part of HTML. However, the idea is that it would be used something like this:

```html
<button id="active-button">Active Button</button>
<button id="inert-button" inert>Inert Button</button>
```

In this example, the second button would be in an inert state, making it non-interactive while the first button remains active.

**SEO and the "inert" Attribute (Concept):**
Since the "inert" attribute concept doesn't yet exist as part of the HTML standard, it doesn't have direct implications for SEO as of my last update.

**Additional Notes:**
- The "inert" attribute could potentially be helpful in enhancing accessibility by preventing focus from being shifted to non-interactive elements.
- The concept aims to simplify user interfaces and prevent unexpected interactions.
- Support and implementation details for the "inert" attribute would depend on future updates to browser specifications and standards.

**Browser Support (Concept):**
As of my last update, the "inert" attribute is not a standardized feature and is not supported in current web browsers. Its implementation would depend on whether browser vendors choose to adopt and implement the proposal in the future.

Please note that developments in web technologies can occur after my last update in September 2021. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about the "inert" attribute concept, consult the latest HTML specification, browser documentation, and web standards resources.
