**CSS Compositing and Blending**

**What:**
CSS compositing and blending refer to techniques that allow you to control how different layers of content are combined and blended together visually. These features are used to create complex visual effects by controlling how colors interact with each other.

**Example:**
Here's an example of using CSS blending modes to combine two overlapping images:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .image-container {
    position: relative;
  }

  .image {
    width: 300px;
    height: 200px;
  }

  .overlay {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    mix-blend-mode: overlay;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="image-container">
  <img class="image" src="background-image.jpg" alt="Background Image">
  <img class="overlay" src="overlay-image.png" alt="Overlay Image">
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Why:**
Compositing and blending provide a way to create visually striking effects that enhance the design and user experience of a webpage. These techniques can be used to achieve creative overlays, highlight certain content, and add depth to the visual presentation.

**Where:**
Compositing and blending are often used in multimedia-rich websites, image galleries, artistic displays, and interfaces that require unique visual effects.

**How:**
- **Compositing:** Specifies how elements stack and interact with each other. You can use properties like `position`, `z-index`, and CSS Grid/Flexbox for controlling stacking order.
- **Blending:** Specifies how colors from different layers blend together. You use the `mix-blend-mode` property to apply different blending modes, such as `multiply`, `screen`, `overlay`, `soft-light`, and more.

**SEO:**
Compositing and blending are primarily visual design techniques and do not have a direct impact on SEO. However, they can enhance the visual appeal of your website and contribute to a more engaging user experience.

**Additional Notes:**
- Be cautious with heavy use of blending modes, as they can impact text readability and overall usability.
- Some blending modes might not behave as expected in all situations or across all browsers, so testing is essential.
- These techniques can be used creatively to achieve effects like duotones, gradient maps, and more.

**Browser Support:**
Most modern browsers support CSS compositing and blending features. However, browser support for specific blending modes might vary, and some older browsers might not fully support all properties. Always test your effects across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
