The `mask-border-outset` CSS property is used to specify the outset, or distance, of a mask border relative to the border box of an element. It controls how far the mask border extends beyond the actual border of the element. This property is used in conjunction with the `mask-border` property to define mask borders with images or gradients.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the `mask-border-outset` property using the provided template:

### **What is `mask-border-outset`?**
The `mask-border-outset` property in CSS is used to define the outset, or distance, of a mask border relative to the border box of an element. It specifies how far the mask border extends beyond the element's actual border.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `mask-border-outset` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  mask-border-outset: values;
}
```

Where `selector` is the target element, and `values` represent one or more lengths or numbers that define the outset in the form of space-separated values.

### **Example:**
```css
.element {
  mask-border: url('mask-image.png') 10 fill;
  mask-border-outset: 5px;
}
```

In the example above, the `.element` will have a mask border applied from the `mask-image.png` with a 10px slice and filled repetition, and the mask border will extend 5 pixels beyond the element's actual border.

### **Values of `mask-border-outset`:**
- You can use length values (e.g., pixels, em) or numbers to define the outset distance.

### **Why Use `mask-border-outset`?**
The `mask-border-outset` property allows you to control how far a mask border extends beyond the element's actual border. This can be useful to create spacing or visual effects between the mask border and the element's content.

### **Where to Use `mask-border-outset`?**
Use the `mask-border-outset` property in conjunction with the `mask-border` property on elements where you want to apply a mask border with a specified outset.

### **How to Use `mask-border-outset`:**
1. Determine the desired outset distance for the mask border.
2. Apply the `mask-border-outset` property to the element, specifying the outset value.

### **Example Values:**
- `mask-border-outset: 10px;`: Extends the mask border 10 pixels beyond the element's border.
- `mask-border-outset: 0;`: No outset; the mask border aligns with the element's border.

### **SEO Considerations:**
The `mask-border-outset` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. It's primarily used for styling and visual effects.

### **Additional Notes:**
- The `mask-border-outset` property is used in combination with the `mask-border` property.
- The values can be negative, which will make the mask border appear within the element's border.

### **Browser Support:**
The `mask-border-outset` property is supported in modern browsers. However, as with any CSS property, it's recommended to check compatibility and test the desired effects in different browsers.
