The `color-adjust` CSS property (not `print-color-adjust`) is used to specify how an element's background and borders should be adjusted when printing a web page. It is primarily used for print stylesheets to control how background colors and borders are rendered in the print version of a web page. Let's break down its usage:

1. **What is `color-adjust`**:
   - `color-adjust` is a CSS property that controls how background colors and borders are adjusted when printing a web page. It allows you to ensure that the printed version of a page looks as intended.

2. **Why Use `color-adjust`**:
   - `color-adjust` is used in print stylesheets to maintain the visual integrity of a web page when it's printed. By default, some browsers may adjust background colors and borders to save ink or toner. This property lets you control whether or not these adjustments are made.

3. **Where to Apply `color-adjust`**:
   - You should apply `color-adjust` to specific HTML elements within your print stylesheet where you want to control the adjustment behavior.

4. **How to Use `color-adjust`**:
   - You can use `color-adjust` in your CSS stylesheet for print using the following syntax:
   
     ```css
     element {
       color-adjust: value;
     }
     ```
   
     Replace `element` with the selector for the HTML element you want to style and `value` with one of the following values:
     
     - `economy`: Allows the browser to adjust background colors and borders to save ink or toner when printing. This is the default behavior.
     - `exact`: Prevents the browser from adjusting background colors and borders, ensuring that they are printed as-is.

5. **SEO Implications**:
   - `color-adjust` primarily affects the appearance of a web page when it's printed. It doesn't have direct SEO implications, as SEO focuses on content accessibility, quality, and search engine ranking.

6. **Additional Notes**:
   - It's essential to consider the accessibility of your printed content when using `color-adjust`. Ensure that printed text remains legible and that the visual appearance remains consistent with the on-screen version.
   - While `color-adjust` can help maintain the appearance of backgrounds and borders, other print-specific styles may be needed for optimizing the overall print layout.

7. **Browser Support**:
   - `color-adjust` is supported in some modern web browsers, but its support may not be universal. Always test your print stylesheets across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.

Here's an example of how to use `color-adjust` in a print stylesheet:

```css
@media print {
  .highlighted-section {
    color-adjust: exact;
    background-color: yellow;
    border: 1px solid #000;
  }
}
```

In this example, when printing, the `.highlighted-section` elements will have their background color and border printed exactly as specified, without any adjustments by the browser to save ink or toner. This ensures that the highlighted sections are visually consistent in the printout.
