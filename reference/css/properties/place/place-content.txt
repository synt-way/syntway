The `place-content` CSS property is part of the CSS Grid Layout specification, and it allows you to align both the content and items within a grid container in both the horizontal and vertical directions. It's a shorthand property that combines the `align-content` and `justify-content` properties, making it easier to control the alignment of items in a grid container.

Here's a detailed explanation of `place-content`:

1. **What is `place-content`**:
   - `place-content` is a CSS property used in grid layouts to control the alignment of both rows and columns within a grid container. It sets the `align-content` and `justify-content` properties simultaneously.

2. **Why Use `place-content`**:
   - `place-content` simplifies the process of aligning grid items both horizontally and vertically within a grid container. It's particularly useful for creating responsive and centered layouts in grid-based designs.

3. **Where to Apply `place-content`**:
   - You can apply `place-content` to a CSS grid container element to control the alignment of its content.

4. **How to Use `place-content`**:
   - You can use `place-content` in your CSS stylesheet using the following syntax:
   
     ```css
     .grid-container {
       place-content: <align-content-value> <justify-content-value>;
     }
     ```
   
     Replace `.grid-container` with the selector for the HTML element that is a grid container, `<align-content-value>` with one of the values for vertical alignment (e.g., `start`, `center`, `end`, `space-between`, `space-around`, or `space-evenly`), and `<justify-content-value>` with one of the values for horizontal alignment (e.g., `start`, `center`, `end`, `space-between`, `space-around`, or `space-evenly`).

5. **SEO Implications**:
   - `place-content` primarily affects the layout and alignment of elements within a grid container. It doesn't have direct SEO implications, as SEO focuses on content accessibility, quality, and search engine ranking.

6. **Additional Notes**:
   - The `place-content` property is often used in responsive web design to control the positioning of grid items based on the available space in the grid container.
   - It can be particularly helpful when you want to center grid items both horizontally and vertically within a grid, creating balanced layouts.

7. **Browser Support**:
   - `place-content` is supported in modern web browsers that support the CSS Grid Layout specification. This includes popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera. However, always check for compatibility if you need to support older browsers.

Here's an example of how to use `place-content` in CSS:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  place-content: center space-between;
  height: 300px;
}

.grid-item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: #3498db;
  color: #fff;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 100px;
}
```

In this example, the `.grid-container` is set to be a grid container with a height of 300 pixels. The `place-content` property centers the content both horizontally and vertically, creating a centered and spaced-between layout for the grid items with the class `.grid-item`.
