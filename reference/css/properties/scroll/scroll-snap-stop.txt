The CSS property `scroll-snap-stop` was proposed as part of the CSS Scroll Snap Module Level 1, but as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, it had limited or no browser support, and it was not widely adopted. However, I can provide an explanation of its intended purpose and potential usage:

**1. What is `scroll-snap-stop`?**
   - `scroll-snap-stop` is a CSS property that was designed to control whether scrolling should stop at particular points within a scroll container. It was intended to help create more controlled and user-friendly scrolling experiences.

**2. Why is `scroll-snap-stop` used?**
   - The purpose of `scroll-snap-stop` is to allow web developers to specify points within a scroll container where scrolling should naturally stop or "snap." This property could be used to create smoother scrolling behavior and ensure that users do not overshoot important content.

**3. Where can `scroll-snap-stop` be used?**
   - In theory, `scroll-snap-stop` could be applied to elements within a scroll container to define specific points where scrolling should halt. It could be used in various scrollable components, such as carousels, image galleries, or any situation where precise scrolling behavior is desired.

**4. How to use `scroll-snap-stop` (hypothetical usage, as it was not widely supported)?**
   - The intended usage might look like this:

   ```css
   .scroll-item {
     scroll-snap-stop: always; /* Or other values like normal or never */
   }
   ```

   In this hypothetical example, `.scroll-item` represents elements within a scroll container, and `scroll-snap-stop` is set to "always" to indicate that scrolling should stop at these elements.

**5. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) impact:**
   - Since `scroll-snap-stop` had limited or no browser support, it did not have a direct impact on SEO. However, if it were to become widely supported, it could potentially enhance user experience and engagement, indirectly benefiting SEO.

**6. Additional notes:**
   - As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, `scroll-snap-stop` was not supported in major browsers. Its lack of support may be due to limited use cases and alternative methods for achieving similar scrolling behavior, such as using `scroll-snap-type` and `scroll-snap-align` properties.
   - Developers looking for scroll snapping functionality should consider using the more widely supported properties like `scroll-snap-type` and `scroll-snap-align` to achieve their desired scroll behavior.

**7. Browser support (as of September 2021):**
   - `scroll-snap-stop` had limited or no browser support at that time. Browser support may have changed since then, so it's essential to check the latest compatibility data on websites like MDN Web Docs or Can I use if you intend to use this property in your web projects.

Please verify the current browser support and adoption status of `scroll-snap-stop` before considering its use in your web development projects.
