The `animation-iteration-count` property in CSS is used to specify the number of times an animation should be repeated. It defines how many cycles of the animation should be played before it stops. This property provides control over the repetition of animations.

**Example:**
```css
.spin {
  animation: spin 2s linear infinite; /* Animation that spins infinitely */
}

@keyframes spin {
  from { transform: rotate(0); }
  to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
```

**Why:**
The `animation-iteration-count` property is used when you want to determine how many times an animation should be repeated. It's useful for creating animations that loop a specific number of times or those that run infinitely.

**Where:**
Apply the `animation-iteration-count` property to the element you're animating to specify how many times the animation should repeat.

**How:**
The `animation-iteration-count` property accepts values like a positive integer (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`) to specify the number of times the animation should repeat, or `infinite` to indicate that the animation should repeat indefinitely.

**SEO:**
The `animation-iteration-count` property and animations themselves don't have a direct impact on SEO. However, animations can enhance user engagement and experience.

**Additional Notes:**
- You can combine `animation-iteration-count` with other animation properties like `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, and `animation-timing-function` to create more complex animations.
- An `animation-iteration-count` of `0` effectively disables the animation, as it will not be played.

**Browser Support:**
The `animation-iteration-count` property is supported in modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It is widely supported and provides consistent behavior across these browsers.
