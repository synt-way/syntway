Certainly, I apologize for any confusion. Let's focus specifically on the `border-left-color` property in CSS:

**What is `border-left-color`?**
`border-left-color` is a CSS property used to set the color of the left border of an element. It allows you to specify the color that should be applied to the left border, which is part of the element's overall border.

**Why is `border-left-color` used?**
When you want to customize the color of the left border of an element, you use the `border-left-color` property to define the color that should be applied to that border side.

**How to use `border-left-color`?**
The syntax is straightforward:

```css
element {
  border-left-color: color;
}
```

Replace `color` with the desired color value. It can be a named color, hexadecimal value, RGB value, etc.

Here's an example:

```css
/* Apply a specific color to the left border of an element */
.element {
  border-left: 2px solid; /* Define border style and width */
  border-left-color: blue; /* Set the color of the left border */
}
```

**Additional Notes:**
- The `border-left-color` property works in conjunction with other border-related properties like `border-left-width` and `border-left-style`.
- It's often used to add a specific color to a particular side of an element's border.

**Browser Support:**
As of my last update in September 2021, `border-left-color` is widely supported in modern browsers. However, it's always good to verify the latest browser compatibility information on websites like MDN Web Docs or Can I use.

I appreciate your patience, and I hope this provides clear information about the `border-left-color` property. If you have more questions, feel free to ask!
