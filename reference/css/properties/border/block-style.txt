The `border-block-style` property in CSS is used to set the style of the block-level borders on all sides of an element that participate in the block formatting context. This includes the start, end, before, and after sides based on the writing mode of the content.

**Example:**
```css
.container {
  border-block-style: dashed; /* Set the style of the block-level borders to dashed */
}
```

**Why:**
The `border-block-style` property allows you to define the style for all block-level borders of an element. It's useful when you want to apply a consistent border style to all sides of the element within the block formatting context.

**Where:**
Apply the `border-block-style` property to block-level elements where you want to set the border style for all sides that participate in the block formatting context.

**How:**
Set the value of the `border-block-style` property to one of the available border styles, such as `none`, `solid`, `dotted`, `dashed`, etc.

**SEO:**
The `border-block-style` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, using it to enhance the visual appearance of your content can contribute to a better user experience.

**Additional Notes:**
- To set different styles for individual sides of the block-level element's borders, you can use properties like `border-block-start-style`, `border-block-end-style`, `border-inline-start-style`, and `border-inline-end-style`.
- The `border-block-style` property applies to block-level elements within the block formatting context, which means elements that establish their own block-level formatting context.

**Browser Support:**
The `border-block-style` property is supported in modern browsers. However, it's important to note that support might vary for older browsers. Always ensure to test your styles across different browsers to ensure consistent rendering.
