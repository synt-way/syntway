The `mask-composite` CSS property is used to control how the mask and the element's background are combined together in terms of visual composition. It determines how the mask and the background are blended, revealing or hiding parts of the background based on the mask's content.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the `mask-composite` property using the provided template:

### **What is `mask-composite`?**
The `mask-composite` property in CSS is used to define how the mask and the background of an element are combined visually. It specifies the blending mode between the mask and the element's background, determining how they interact and affect the overall visual appearance.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `mask-composite` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  mask-composite: value;
}
```

Where `selector` is the target element, and `value` represents a keyword indicating the desired blending mode.

### **Example:**
```css
.element {
  background-color: blue;
  mask: url('mask-image.png');
  mask-composite: source-over;
}
```

In the example above, the `.element` will have a blue background, and the mask from `mask-image.png` will be combined with the background using the `source-over` blending mode.

### **Values of `mask-composite`:**
- `add`: The mask and the background are added together, resulting in an additive blending mode.
- `subtract`: The mask's content is subtracted from the background, revealing the background.
- `intersect`: Only the overlapping areas of the mask and the background are displayed.
- `exclude`: The overlapping areas of the mask and the background are excluded, creating a subtractive effect.
- `source-over` (default): The mask is combined with the background using the "source over" blending mode.

### **Why Use `mask-composite`?**
The `mask-composite` property allows you to control how the mask interacts with the background, creating various visual effects and compositions.

### **Where to Use `mask-composite`?**
Use the `mask-composite` property on elements where you've applied a mask using the `mask` property and want to define how the mask interacts with the background.

### **How to Use `mask-composite`:**
1. Choose the desired blending mode (`add`, `subtract`, `intersect`, `exclude`, or a predefined blending mode).
2. Apply the `mask-composite` property to the element, specifying the chosen value.

### **Example Values:**
- `mask-composite: add;`: Adds the mask and the background together in an additive blending mode.
- `mask-composite: subtract;`: Subtracts the mask's content from the background.
- `mask-composite: intersect;`: Displays only the overlapping areas of the mask and background.
- `mask-composite: exclude;`: Excludes the overlapping areas of the mask and background.
- `mask-composite: source-over;`: Uses the "source over" default blending mode.

### **SEO Considerations:**
The `mask-composite` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. It's primarily used for styling and visual effects.

### **Additional Notes:**
- The `mask-composite` property modifies the visual composition of the mask and the background.
- The behavior may vary depending on the blending mode used.

### **Browser Support:**
The `mask-composite` property is supported in modern browsers. However, browser support can vary for specific blending modes or values. Always test in different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
