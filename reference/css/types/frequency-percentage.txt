It seems you're using angle brackets ("<" and ">") to enclose a term, but "frequency-percentage" doesn't appear to be a standard or recognized term in web development or CSS. However, I can provide information on a related concept that might be what you're looking for: "percentage values" in CSS.

**1. What are Percentage Values in CSS?**
   - **Definition:** Percentage values in CSS are used to express measurements relative to the size or property of a parent element. They are often used for dimensions, positioning, or other properties to create responsive and scalable designs.

**2. Why Use Percentage Values?**
   - **Responsiveness:** Percentage values allow elements to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions, making layouts responsive.
   - **Scalability:** Elements can scale proportionally based on the size of their parent container.
   - **Relative Sizing:** Percentage values provide a way to specify dimensions relative to parent elements.

**3. Where are Percentage Values Used?**
   - **Layouts:** Commonly used in responsive web design to create fluid and adaptable layouts.
   - **Dimensions:** Applied to width, height, margins, padding, and positioning properties to create flexible designs.
   - **Font Size:** Percentage values can be used to specify font sizes relative to the parent element's font size.

**4. How to Use Percentage Values in CSS:**
   - **Example 1:** Specifying a percentage width for an element:
     ```css
     .container {
       width: 80%;
     }
     ```

   - **Example 2:** Scaling text size relative to the parent element's font size:
     ```css
     .sub-heading {
       font-size: 120%;
     }
     ```

**5. SEO Implications:**
   - The use of percentage values in CSS itself does not have a direct impact on SEO. However, responsive design practices that involve percentage values can improve user experience, which indirectly affects SEO.

**6. Additional Notes:**
   - **Relative Units:** Percentage values are considered relative units, and they are often compared to other relative units like ems and rems.
   - **Caveats:** Be mindful of using percentage values in certain contexts, as they can lead to unexpected behavior if not properly understood or applied.

**7. Browser Support:**
   - Percentage values are a fundamental part of CSS and are widely supported in all modern web browsers. They are a core concept in creating responsive web designs.

In summary, percentage values in CSS are used to express measurements relative to the size or property of a parent element. They are a key component of responsive web design and allow for flexible and scalable layouts. While they do not directly impact SEO, they are essential for creating a positive user experience on different devices and screen sizes.
