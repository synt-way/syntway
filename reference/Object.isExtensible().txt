The `Object.isExtensible()` method in JavaScript is used to check if an object is extensible, meaning whether new properties can be added to it or not. It returns a boolean value, indicating whether the object is extensible or not. Here's a detailed explanation:

**1. What is the `Object.isExtensible()` Method?**
   - **Definition:** The `Object.isExtensible()` method is a built-in JavaScript method that checks if an object is extensible, meaning it can have new properties added to it.

**2. Why Use the `Object.isExtensible()` Method?**
   - **Property Additions:** It is used when you need to determine if you can add new properties to an object, especially in situations where you want to control the mutability of objects.
   - **Object Safety:** It helps ensure that an object is protected from accidental property additions.

**3. Where is the `Object.isExtensible()` Method Used in JavaScript?**
   - **Object Mutability:** It is used in various JavaScript scenarios to ensure the mutability or immutability of objects.

**4. How to Use the `Object.isExtensible()` Method:**
   - **Syntax:**
     ```javascript
     Object.isExtensible(obj)
     ```

   - **Example 1:** Checking if an object is extensible:
     ```javascript
     const obj1 = {};
     console.log(Object.isExtensible(obj1)); // true

     Object.preventExtensions(obj1); // Make the object non-extensible
     console.log(Object.isExtensible(obj1)); // false
     ```

   - **Example 2:** Checking extensibility of built-in objects (not recommended):
     ```javascript
     const array = [];
     console.log(Object.isExtensible(array)); // true

     Object.preventExtensions(array); // Make the array non-extensible
     console.log(Object.isExtensible(array)); // false
     ```

**5. SEO Implications:**
   - The use of the `Object.isExtensible()` method in JavaScript does not have a direct impact on SEO. SEO primarily focuses on content, meta tags, and other non-technical factors.

**6. Additional Notes:**
   - Extensibility can be controlled using methods like `Object.preventExtensions()` to make an object non-extensible or `Object.seal()` and `Object.freeze()` to make objects even more immutable.
   - Objects are extensible by default unless specific measures are taken to make them non-extensible.

**7. Browser Support:**
   - The `Object.isExtensible()` method is supported in all modern web browsers and JavaScript environments.

In summary, the `Object.isExtensible()` method in JavaScript is used to check if an object is extensible, allowing new properties to be added. It is commonly used to control the mutability of objects. However, it does not have a direct impact on SEO.
