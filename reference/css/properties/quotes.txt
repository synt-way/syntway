The `quotes` CSS property is used to specify quotation marks for inline quotations in text. It allows you to define custom quotation mark styles, such as different opening and closing quotation marks, to enhance the typography and design of your text. Here's a detailed explanation of `quotes`:

1. **What is `quotes`**:
   - `quotes` is a CSS property that allows you to define custom quotation marks for inline quotations within text content. It specifies the characters to be used as opening and closing quotation marks.

2. **Why Use `quotes`**:
   - `quotes` is used to improve the typographic presentation of quotations in textual content. It lets you define your preferred quotation mark styles, which can be particularly useful for styling blockquotes or citations.
   - Customizing quotation marks can enhance the design and readability of your content and is commonly used in editorial and publication design.

3. **Where to Apply `quotes`**:
   - You should apply the `quotes` property to the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements of elements containing quoted text, typically `<q>`, `<blockquote>`, or `<cite>` elements.

4. **How to Use `quotes`**:
   - You can use `quotes` in your CSS stylesheet using the following syntax:
   
     ```css
     element::before {
       content: open-quote;
     }
     
     element::after {
       content: close-quote;
     }
     ```
   
     Replace `element` with the selector for the HTML element containing the quoted text. Use `open-quote` and `close-quote` for the `content` property to specify the opening and closing quotation marks.

5. **SEO Implications**:
   - `quotes` primarily affects the visual presentation of text content and doesn't have direct SEO implications. SEO focuses on content accessibility, quality, and search engine ranking.

6. **Additional Notes**:
   - When using `quotes`, it's essential to consider accessibility. Ensure that your chosen quotation mark styles are still legible and distinguishable for all users, including those using screen readers.
   - Different languages and writing systems may have varying conventions for quotation marks. You can use the `quotes` property to adapt to these conventions.

7. **Browser Support**:
   - `quotes` is supported in modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera. However, browser support for some advanced quotation mark styles may vary, so it's a good practice to test across different browsers.

Here's an example of how to use `quotes` in CSS:

```css
blockquote::before {
  content: open-quote;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 20px;
  color: #333;
}

blockquote::after {
  content: close-quote;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 20px;
  color: #333;
}
```

In this example, the `blockquote` elements will have custom quotation marks defined by the `quotes` property. The `open-quote` and `close-quote` values are used for the `content` property to specify the opening and closing quotation marks. Additionally, styles like `font-weight`, `font-size`, and `color` are applied to the quotation marks for customization.
