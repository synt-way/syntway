The `grid-template` CSS property is a shorthand property used within a grid layout to specify both the grid's column and row tracks, along with the sizing and naming of those tracks. It combines the `grid-template-rows`, `grid-template-columns`, and optionally `grid-template-areas` properties into a single declaration.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the `grid-template` property using the provided template:

### **What is `grid-template`?**
The `grid-template` property in CSS is a shorthand property used to define the grid's column and row tracks, as well as their sizing and naming within a grid container. It combines several grid-related properties into a single declaration.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `grid-template` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  grid-template: [row-start] / [column-start] [column-end] / [row-end];
}
```

Where `selector` is the target grid container, and the values within the brackets represent the grid track sizing and naming.

### **Example:**
```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template: 100px 150px / 1fr 2fr;
}
```

In the example above, the `.grid-container` has two rows with heights of 100 pixels and 150 pixels, and two columns where the first column takes up one fraction of the available space (1fr) and the second column takes up two fractions (2fr).

### **Why Use `grid-template`?**
The `grid-template` property simplifies the process of defining grid tracks, sizing, and naming within a grid layout, making the code more concise.

### **Where to Use `grid-template`?**
Use the `grid-template` property on a grid container when you want to define the grid's structure, including the sizing and naming of both rows and columns.

### **How to Use `grid-template`:**
1. Determine the desired sizes and order for rows and columns.
2. Apply the `grid-template` property to the grid container, specifying the sizing and naming.

### **Example Values:**
- `grid-template: 1fr 2fr / 150px 200px`: The grid has two rows (1 fraction and 2 fractions) and two columns (150 pixels and 200 pixels).
- `grid-template: "header header" 100px "sidebar content" 1fr "footer footer" 50px / 20% 80%`: The grid has three rows (100 pixels, 1 fraction, and 50 pixels) and three columns (20% and 80%).

### **SEO Considerations:**
The `grid-template` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, using it to create well-structured layouts can enhance user experience and indirectly contribute to SEO.

### **Additional Notes:**
- **Grid Area Names**: You can also include the `grid-template-areas` property to specify the arrangement of grid items using named grid areas.

### **Browser Support:**
The `grid-template` property is supported in modern browsers that also support CSS Grid Layout.

In summary, the `grid-template` CSS property is a powerful shorthand for defining the grid structure, track sizing, and naming within a grid container. It's essential for creating versatile and responsive grid-based designs.
