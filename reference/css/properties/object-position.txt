The `object-position` CSS property is used to control the positioning of an image or video content within its container when using the `object-fit` property. It specifies the horizontal and vertical placement of the content within the container.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the `object-position` property using the provided template:

### **What is `object-position`?**
The `object-position` property in CSS determines the positioning of an image or video content within its container when the `object-fit` property is applied. It allows you to control the exact placement of the content within the container along both the horizontal and vertical axes.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `object-position` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  object-position: x-axis y-axis;
}
```

Where `selector` is the target `<img>` or `<video>` element, and `x-axis` and `y-axis` represent the horizontal and vertical positioning values, respectively.

### **Example:**
```css
.image-container img {
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: center top;
}
```

In the example above, the image's content within the `.image-container` will be covered while positioned at the center horizontally and at the top vertically.

### **Values of `object-position`:**
- `x-axis`: A length or percentage value indicating the horizontal position within the container.
- `y-axis`: A length or percentage value indicating the vertical position within the container.

### **Why Use `object-position`?**
The `object-position` property is used to fine-tune the positioning of an image or video content within its container. It's particularly useful when you want to align certain features or focal points of the content with specific areas of the container.

### **Where to Use `object-position`?**
Use the `object-position` property on `<img>` and `<video>` elements in combination with the `object-fit` property to achieve precise positioning within a container.

### **How to Use `object-position`:**
1. Determine the desired horizontal and vertical positioning values (length or percentage).
2. Apply the `object-position` property to the target `<img>` or `<video>` element.

### **Example Values:**
- `object-position: 50% 50%;`: Positions the content at the center of both axes.
- `object-position: left top;`: Positions the content at the top-left corner.
- `object-position: 20% center;`: Positions the content at 20% from the left and centered vertically.

### **SEO Considerations:**
The `object-position` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. It's primarily used for precise visual layout purposes.

### **Additional Notes:**
- The `object-position` property is often used in combination with the `object-fit` property.
- It's especially useful when aligning focal points of images within containers.

### **Browser Support:**
The `object-position` property is supported in modern browsers. Browser compatibility is generally good, but it's recommended to test across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
