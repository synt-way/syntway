It appears you are asking for information about CSS properties related to pagination, but your request is quite broad. To clarify, there isn't a single "page" CSS property, but rather several properties and concepts related to pagination in CSS, depending on the context.

Here, I'll provide an overview of some of the concepts and properties related to pagination:

1. **Page Breaks**:
   - CSS properties like `page-break-before`, `page-break-after`, and `page-break-inside` are used to control page breaks in print and paginated media. These properties allow you to specify where page breaks should occur, either before or after specific elements or to prevent elements from breaking across pages.

   Example:
   ```css
   h2 {
     page-break-before: always;
   }
   ```

   In this example, a page break is forced before every `<h2>` element when printing.

2. **Multi-Column Layout**:
   - CSS supports multi-column layouts using properties like `column-count` and `column-width`. These properties allow you to create a newspaper-like layout with content flowing into multiple columns.

   Example:
   ```css
   .article {
     column-count: 2;
   }
   ```

   This CSS rule makes elements with the class "article" flow into two columns.

3. **Paged Media**:
   - CSS includes concepts related to paged media, which are stylesheets optimized for print or screen presentation that may involve pagination. You can use `@page` rules and the `size`, `margin`, and other properties to define page styles for printed documents.

   Example:
   ```css
   @page {
     size: A4;
     margin: 1cm;
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `@page` rule defines the size and margin for A4-sized pages.

4. **Pagination for Printing**:
   - CSS properties related to printing can be used to control how web content is formatted and styled when printed. This can include adjusting margins, hiding certain elements, or specifying page breaks.

   Example:
   ```css
   @media print {
     .print-header {
       display: none;
     }
   }
   ```

   This CSS rule hides elements with the class "print-header" when the page is printed.

5. **SEO Implications**:
   - Pagination and print styling primarily affect the presentation and layout of web content for specific media. They don't have direct SEO implications, as SEO focuses on content accessibility, quality, and search engine ranking.

6. **Browser Support**:
   - Support for pagination-related CSS properties and concepts varies among browsers. It's important to test your pagination styles across different browsers to ensure consistent rendering.
