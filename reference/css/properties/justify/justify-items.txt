The `justify-items` CSS property is used in a Grid Layout context to set the horizontal alignment of grid items within their grid cells in the inline (row) direction. It allows you to control how grid items are positioned along the row axis inside their respective grid cells.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the `justify-items` property using the provided template:

### **What is `justify-items`?**
The `justify-items` property in CSS is used within a Grid Layout context to define the horizontal alignment of grid items within their respective grid cells along the inline (row) direction.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `justify-items` property is as follows:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  justify-items: value;
}
```

Where `container` is the grid container element, and `value` is one of the available values that determine how grid items are aligned along the row axis within their cells.

### **Example:**
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  justify-items: center;
}
```

In the example above, the grid items inside the `.container` will be horizontally centered within their respective cells along the row axis.

### **Values of `justify-items`:**
- `start`: Default value. Grid items are aligned to the start of their grid cell along the inline axis.
- `end`: Grid items are aligned to the end of their grid cell along the inline axis.
- `center`: Grid items are centered within their grid cell along the inline axis.
- `stretch`: Grid items are stretched to fill the entire width of their grid cell along the inline axis.
- `self-start`: Aligns grid items to the start of the row axis (similar to `start`, but with self-alignment).
- `self-end`: Aligns grid items to the end of the row axis (similar to `end`, but with self-alignment).
- `self-center`: Centers grid items along the row axis (similar to `center`, but with self-alignment).
- `self-stretch`: Stretches grid items to fill the width of the grid cell along the row axis (similar to `stretch`, but with self-alignment).

### **Why Use `justify-items`?**
The `justify-items` property is used to precisely control how grid items are aligned horizontally within their grid cells. It's especially useful when you want to align items differently within the grid cells without changing the overall layout.

### **Where to Use `justify-items`?**
Use the `justify-items` property on a grid container element to control the horizontal alignment of its grid items within their cells along the inline (row) axis.

### **How to Use `justify-items`:**
1. Determine the desired horizontal alignment for grid items within their cells.
2. Apply the `justify-items` property to the grid container element, specifying the desired value.

### **Example Values:**
- `justify-items: center;`: Centers grid items within their cells along the row axis.
- `justify-items: start;`: Aligns grid items to the start of their cells along the row axis.
- `justify-items: end;`: Aligns grid items to the end of their cells along the row axis.

### **SEO Considerations:**
The `justify-items` property primarily affects the layout and visual presentation of a web page. It doesn't have a direct impact on SEO.

### **Additional Notes:**
- `justify-items` only affects items within the grid cells and not the placement of the cells themselves.
- Combine with other Grid Layout properties for more complex layouts.

### **Browser Support:**
The `justify-items` property is supported in modern browsers that support CSS Grid Layout.

In summary, the `justify-items` CSS property is used within a Grid Layout context to control the horizontal alignment of grid items within their grid cells along the inline (row) direction. It provides fine-grained control over the positioning of items within a grid layout.
