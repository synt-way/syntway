It seems you're using angle brackets ("<" and ">") to enclose a term, but the term "filter-function" is typically used in CSS and SVG to describe a set of functions that apply various visual effects to elements. Let's discuss filter functions:

**1. What is a Filter Function?**
   - **Definition:** A filter function is a set of CSS or SVG functions used to apply visual effects to elements, such as blurs, color adjustments, and other transformations. They can be used to modify the appearance of images, backgrounds, and even text.
   - **Syntax (CSS):** Filter functions are typically applied within CSS using the `filter` property like this:
     ```css
     .image {
       filter: filter-function();
     }
     ```

**2. Why Use Filter Functions?**
   - **Visual Effects:** Filter functions are used to add visual effects to elements, enhancing the aesthetics of a web page.
   - **Image Manipulation:** They can be applied to images to create effects like blurs, grayscale, brightness adjustments, and more.

**3. Where are Filter Functions Used?**
   - **Web Design:** Commonly applied in web design to create visually engaging elements or enhance images.
   - **Image Editing:** Used in web-based image editing tools to apply filters and effects to images.

**4. How to Use Filter Functions?**
   - **Example 1:** Applying a grayscale filter to an image:
     ```css
     .grayscale-image {
       filter: grayscale(100%);
     }
     ```

   - **Example 2:** Applying a blur filter:
     ```css
     .blurred-element {
       filter: blur(5px);
     }
     ```

**5. SEO Implications:**
   - Filter functions themselves do not have a direct impact on SEO. They are related to the visual presentation of content and do not affect search engine rankings.

**6. Additional Notes:**
   - **Common Functions:** Common filter functions include `grayscale()`, `blur()`, `brightness()`, `contrast()`, `sepia()`, and more.
   - **Combining Functions:** Multiple filter functions can be combined to achieve complex visual effects.
   - **Browser Support:** Filter functions are widely supported in modern web browsers, but some older browsers may have limited support.

**7. Browser Support:**
   - Filter functions are supported in modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
   - Be aware of browser compatibility and consider fallbacks for older browsers when using advanced filter functions.

In summary, filter functions are CSS and SVG functions used to apply visual effects to elements, enhancing the aesthetics of web pages. While they don't directly impact SEO, they play a significant role in web design and image manipulation, creating visually appealing content. Filter functions are widely supported in modern browsers, making them a valuable tool for web designers and developers.
