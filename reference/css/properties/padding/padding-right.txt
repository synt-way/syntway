Certainly, let's explore the CSS property `padding-right`:

1. **What is `padding-right`**:
   - `padding-right` is a CSS property used to define the amount of space (padding) between an element's content and its right border. It specifies the distance between the content area and the border on the right side of the element.

2. **Why Use `padding-right`**:
   - `padding-right` is used to create space or separation between an element's content and its right edge. This improves the visual layout and spacing of elements within a webpage.
   - It is particularly useful when you need to control the space between content and the right border, making the content more visually appealing and improving the layout.

3. **Where to Apply `padding-right`**:
   - You can apply `padding-right` to HTML elements such as `<div>`, `<section>`, or any container where you want to adjust the spacing on the right side.

4. **How to Use `padding-right`**:
   - You can use `padding-right` in your CSS stylesheet using the following syntax:
   
     ```css
     element {
       padding-right: value;
     }
     ```
   
     Replace `element` with the selector for the HTML element you want to style and `value` with the desired padding value, specified in pixels (`px`), percentages (`%`), ems (`em`), or other supported units.

5. **SEO Implications**:
   - `padding-right` primarily affects the layout and visual presentation of your webpage. It doesn't have direct SEO implications. However, a well-designed and user-friendly layout can indirectly contribute to a positive user experience, which is important for SEO.

6. **Additional Notes**:
   - `padding-right` can be used in combination with other padding-related properties like `padding-left`, `padding-top`, and `padding-bottom` to control padding on all sides of an element.
   - The total width of an element, including padding, content, and borders, is determined by the sum of these values. Padding values add to the element's overall dimensions.

7. **Browser Support**:
   - `padding-right` is a fundamental CSS property that is supported in all modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera. You can safely use it in your web development projects.

Here's an example of how to use `padding-right` in CSS:

```css
.button {
  padding-right: 15px;
}
```

In this example, the `.button` element will have padding of `15px` on its right side, creating space between its content and the right border. This can help improve the visual spacing and layout of content within the button.
