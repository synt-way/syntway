### **What is `margin-inline`?**
The `margin-inline` property in CSS is used to set the margin spacing in the inline axis (horizontal direction) of an element. It defines the space between the element and its surrounding elements in the horizontal direction, affecting the layout of content.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `margin-inline` property is as follows:

}
```

Where `selector` is the target element, and `value` represents the desired margin spacing in the inline axis.

### **Example:**

In the example above, the `span` elements will have a margin of 10 pixels in the horizontal direction, creating space between the elements and their surrounding elements.

### **Values of `margin-inline`:**
- You can use a single value to set the margin for the inline axis (horizontal direction).

### **Why Use `margin-inline`?**
