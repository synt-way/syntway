The `readonly` attribute is an HTML attribute used with form input elements, such as `<input>` and `<textarea>`, to make the input field non-editable. It prevents users from modifying the content of the input field while still allowing them to see the content and submit it as part of a form.

Here's a detailed explanation of the `readonly` attribute, addressing your requested topics:

**1. What is the `readonly` Attribute?**
The `readonly` attribute is used to make an input field non-editable, meaning users can see the content but can't modify it.

**2. Why Use the `readonly` Attribute?**
Using the `readonly` attribute is useful when you want to display data to users that shouldn't be changed, such as displaying user profile information or calculated values.

**3. Where Can the `readonly` Attribute Be Used?**
The `readonly` attribute can be used with input elements that accept text, such as `<input type="text">` and `<textarea>`.

**4. How to Use the `readonly` Attribute?**
Here's an example of how the `readonly` attribute can be used:

```html
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username" value="john_doe" readonly>

<label for="bio">Bio:</label>
<textarea id="bio" name="bio" readonly>John Doe is a web developer with a passion for coding.</textarea>
```

In this example, both the input field and the textarea are set as `readonly`, preventing users from editing the content.

**5. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and `readonly` Attribute:**
The `readonly` attribute doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. It's mainly a user interface and data display consideration.

**6. Additional Notes:**
- Display-Only: The `readonly` attribute should be used when you want to display content that shouldn't be edited. It's not a security feature, as users can manipulate the HTML source.
- Form Submission: The content of `readonly` fields is still sent with form submissions, so they can be used to send information back to the server.
- Aesthetics: Consider using appropriate styling to differentiate between editable and non-editable fields.

**7. Browser Support:**
The `readonly` attribute is supported by all modern web browsers.

Using the `readonly` attribute is a way to display data to users in a read-only format, ensuring that they can't accidentally or deliberately modify the information.
