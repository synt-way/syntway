The `-webkit-touch-callout` property is a non-standard CSS property used in older versions of WebKit-based browsers (such as Safari) to control whether or not the default callout menu is displayed when a user taps and holds on an element on a touch-enabled device. The callout menu typically includes options like "Copy" and "Define" for text selection. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, this property is still supported in WebKit-based browsers like Safari, but it's not part of the CSS standard and is not supported in other modern browsers like Chrome or Firefox.

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .no-callout {
    -webkit-touch-callout: none; /* Disable the callout menu */
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p class="no-callout">
  This paragraph has the callout menu disabled.
</p>

</body>
</html>
```

**Why:**
The `-webkit-touch-callout` property is used to control the appearance of the default callout menu that appears when a user taps and holds on an element. It's often used to prevent the menu from appearing in specific cases where the default behavior is not desired.

**Where:**
In the context of its historical usage, the `-webkit-touch-callout` property can be applied to elements where you want to prevent the default callout menu from appearing. This is often done for elements that don't require text selection or other actions provided by the callout menu.

**How:**
The `-webkit-touch-callout` property accepts values like `none` and `default`. Setting it to `none` disables the callout menu, while setting it to `default` allows the default behavior.

**SEO:**
The `-webkit-touch-callout` property and its usage have no direct impact on SEO, as it's primarily a styling property that affects the user experience on touch devices.

**Additional Notes:**
- `-webkit-touch-callout` is specific to WebKit-based browsers like Safari and is not part of the CSS standard.
- While this property can be used to disable the callout menu, it might impact the user experience, especially for elements where callout options are expected.

**Browser Support:**
The `-webkit-touch-callout` property is supported in older versions of WebKit-based browsers like Safari. It's not supported in other modern browsers like Chrome or Firefox. When using this property, consider providing alternative behaviors for other browsers or using other techniques for broader compatibility.
