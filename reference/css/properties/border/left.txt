I apologize for any misunderstanding. Let me provide a more concise response while addressing all the aspects you mentioned earlier.

**What is `border-left`?**
The `border-left` property in CSS is used to set the properties of the left border of an element. It's a shorthand property that combines `border-left-width`, `border-left-style`, and `border-left-color` into one declaration.

**Why is `border-left` used?**
`border-left` is used to efficiently set the left border properties of an element, providing control over its width, style, and color in a single declaration.

**Where is `border-left` used?**
This property is applied to CSS styling and is commonly used in various web design scenarios where left borders need to be styled.

**How to use `border-left`?**
The syntax is:
```css
element {
  border-left: [border-width] [border-style] [border-color];
}
```

Here's an example:
```css
/* Apply a left border to an element */
.element {
  border-left: 2px solid red;
}
```

**SEO Implications:**
The `border-left` property itself doesn't have direct SEO implications. SEO primarily focuses on content, keywords, page structure, and meta information.

**Additional Notes:**
- `border-left` is a shorthand for setting left border properties.
- Individual properties like `border-left-width`, `border-left-style`, and `border-left-color` can also be used.

**Browser Support:**
As of my last update in September 2021, `border-left` is widely supported in modern browsers. However, always check for the latest browser compatibility information on websites like MDN Web Docs or Can I use.

I hope this response better addresses your query. If you have further questions, please feel free to ask.
