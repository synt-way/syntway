The `<video>` element is used to embed video content directly within an HTML document. It allows you to include videos for playback without requiring third-party plugins. With the `<video>` element, you can provide multiple video sources in different formats to ensure compatibility across various web browsers and devices.

Here's a detailed explanation of the `<video>` element, addressing your requested topics:

**1. What is the `<video>` Element?**

**2. Why Use the `<video>` Element?**

**3. Where Can the `<video>` Element Be Used?**

**4. How to Use the `<video>` Element?**
