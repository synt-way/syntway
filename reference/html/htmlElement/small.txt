As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the `<small>` element is not specifically designated as a "side comment" element. Instead, it is used to indicate that the enclosed text is of smaller font size or to represent secondary or fine print content within the context of its parent element. The purpose and usage of the `<small>` element may vary depending on the specific context in which it is used.

Here's a general explanation of the `<small>` element:

**1. What is the `<small>` Element?**
The `<small>` element is used to indicate that the enclosed text should be rendered in a smaller font size than the surrounding text. It's often used for disclaimers, copyright notices, fine print, and other similar content that is secondary in nature.

**2. Why Use the `<small>` Element?**
Using the `<small>` element allows you to visually differentiate certain content as less important or secondary, while keeping it legible and aligned with the overall design.

**3. Where Can the `<small>` Element Be Used?**
The `<small>` element can be used within various HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs, list items, and others.

**4. How to Use the `<small>` Element?**
Here's an example of how the `<small>` element can be used:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph with some <small>small text</small> included.</p>
```

In this example, the text "small text" would be rendered in a smaller font size than the rest of the paragraph text.

**5. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and `<small>` Elements:**
The `<small>` element itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. Its primary purpose is for visual styling.

**6. Additional Notes:**
- Styling: The appearance of the `<small>` element's content, including font size, can be further styled using CSS.

**7. Browser Support:**
The `<small>` element is supported by all modern web browsers.

Please note that the interpretation and usage of HTML elements can evolve over time, and different developers or sources might use elements in various ways. If there have been changes or updates to the usage of the `<small>` element since September 2021, I recommend referring to up-to-date resources or official HTML documentation for the latest information.
