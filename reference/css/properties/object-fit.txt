The `object-fit` CSS property is used to control how the content of an `<img>` or `<video>` element is displayed within its container, especially when the aspect ratio of the content and container differ. It helps in adjusting the sizing and positioning of the content within the container.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the `object-fit` property using the provided template:

### **What is `object-fit`?**
The `object-fit` property in CSS controls how an image or video content is fitted inside its container. It helps in maintaining the aspect ratio of the content while specifying how it should be sized and positioned within the container.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `object-fit` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  object-fit: value;
}
```

Where `selector` is the target `<img>` or `<video>` element, and `value` represents the desired fitting behavior.

### **Example:**
```css
.image-container {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
}

.image-container img {
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

In the example above, the image inside the `.image-container` will be sized and positioned using the "cover" value for `object-fit`.

### **Values of `object-fit`:**
- `fill`: The content is stretched to fill the container, potentially distorting the aspect ratio.
- `contain`: The content is scaled to fit the container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It may result in empty space within the container.
- `cover`: The content is scaled to cover the container while maintaining its aspect ratio. Some content may be cropped.
- `none`: The content is displayed at its natural size, ignoring the container's dimensions.
- `scale-down`: Similar to `contain`, but the content is scaled down if it's larger than the container.

### **Why Use `object-fit`?**
The `object-fit` property is used to handle responsive image and video display. It's especially useful when you want to control how media content behaves within different container sizes and aspect ratios.

### **Where to Use `object-fit`?**
Use the `object-fit` property on `<img>` and `<video>` elements where you want to control how their content is fitted within a container.

### **How to Use `object-fit`:**
1. Choose a fitting behavior from the list of available values.
2. Apply the `object-fit` property to the target `<img>` or `<video>` element.

### **Example Values:**
- `object-fit: fill;`: Stretches the content to fill the container, potentially distorting the aspect ratio.
- `object-fit: contain;`: Fits the content within the container, maintaining the aspect ratio.
- `object-fit: cover;`: Covers the container with the content, cropping if necessary.
- `object-fit: none;`: Displays the content at its natural size.
- `object-fit: scale-down;`: Fits the content within the container, scaling down if needed.

### **SEO Considerations:**
The `object-fit` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. It's primarily used for responsive design and layout purposes.

### **Additional Notes:**
- The `object-fit` property can interact with other CSS properties, such as `width`, `height`, and `position`.
- The `object-position` property can be used in combination with `object-fit` to control the positioning of the content within the container.

### **Browser Support:**
The `object-fit` property is supported in modern browsers. Browser compatibility is generally good, but always test across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
