Certainly, let's provide an in-depth explanation of the `border-right-style` property, covering all the aspects you mentioned:

**What is `border-right-style`?**
The `border-right-style` property in CSS is used to set the style of the right border of an element. It allows you to specify how the right border should be displayed, whether it's solid, dashed, dotted, or another available style.

**Why is `border-right-style` used?**
When you want to control the visual style of the right border of an element, you use the `border-right-style` property to define how that border should be rendered.

**How to use `border-right-style`?**
The syntax is simple:

```css
element {
  border-right-style: style;
}
```

Replace `style` with the desired border style, such as `solid`, `dashed`, `dotted`, `double`, and others.

Here's an example:

```css
/* Apply a specific border style to the right side of an element */
.element {
  border-right-style: dashed;
  border-right-width: 2px; /* Define border width */
  border-right-color: green; /* Define border color */
}
```

This property is applied within your CSS styles and can be used whenever you want to customize the style of the right border of an element.

**SEO Implications:**
The `border-right-style` property itself doesn't have direct SEO implications. SEO primarily focuses on content, keywords, page structure, and meta information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `border-right-style` property is often used in conjunction with other border-related properties like `border-right-width` and `border-right-color`.
- By setting different border styles, you can create various visual effects for the right border.

**Browser Support:**
As of my last update in September 2021, `border-right-style` is widely supported in modern browsers. However, it's always good to verify the latest browser compatibility information on websites like MDN Web Docs or Can I use.
