The `math-style` CSS property is used in conjunction with the `display: inline-block` or `display: block` and `display: inline` values on elements that contain MathML content. It defines the preferred math style (e.g., display or script) for rendering the MathML content within the element.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the `math-style` property using the provided template:

### **What is `math-style`?**
The `math-style` property in CSS is used to specify the preferred rendering style for MathML content within an element. It works in combination with the `display: inline-block`, `display: block`, and `display: inline` values to influence the presentation of MathML math equations.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `math-style` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  math-style: value;
}
```

Where `selector` is the target element containing MathML content, and `value` represents the desired rendering style for the MathML equations.

### **Example:**
```css
.math-equation {
  display: block;
  math-style: display;
}
```

In the example above, the `.math-equation` element contains MathML content and is set to display as a block-level element with the preferred math style set to `display`.

### **Values of `math-style`:**
- `display`: Indicates that the preferred rendering style for MathML equations is the display style.
- `text`: Indicates that the preferred rendering style for MathML equations is the text style.
- `script`: Indicates that the preferred rendering style for MathML equations is the script style.

### **Why Use `math-style`?**
The `math-style` property allows you to specify the desired rendering style for MathML equations within an element. This can be helpful in ensuring that mathematical content is presented consistently and optimally for various display contexts.

### **Where to Use `math-style`?**
Use the `math-style` property on elements that contain MathML content and need to specify the preferred rendering style for their contained mathematical equations.

### **How to Use `math-style`:**
1. Determine the desired math style (`display`, `text`, or `script`).
2. Apply the `math-style` property to the element containing MathML content, along with appropriate `display` values.

### **Example Values:**
- `math-style: display;`: Specifies the preferred rendering style as the display style.
- `math-style: text;`: Specifies the preferred rendering style as the text style.
- `math-style: script;`: Specifies the preferred rendering style as the script style.

### **SEO Considerations:**
The `math-style` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. It's used for formatting mathematical content within the MathML structure.

### **Additional Notes:**
- The `math-style` property is used in combination with the `display` property to determine how MathML content is displayed.
- It's primarily relevant when dealing with MathML content in HTML documents.

### **Browser Support:**
The `math-style` property is specific to MathML content and might not be supported or recognized by all browsers. Ensure you're using it in an appropriate context and test in browsers that support MathML.

Please note that browser support and specific syntax details may have evolved after my last knowledge update in September 2021. Always refer to up-to-date documentation and resources for the latest information on CSS properties and MathML integration.
