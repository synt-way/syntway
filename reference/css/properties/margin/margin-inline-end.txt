### **What is `margin-inline-end`?**
The `margin-inline-end` property in CSS is used to set the margin spacing on the inline-end side of an element. It defines the space between the element's inline-end edge and the adjacent content in the horizontal direction (inline direction).

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `margin-inline-end` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  margin-inline-end: value;

```

Where `selector` is the target element, and `value` represents the desired margin spacing on the inline-end side.

### **Example:**
```css
span {
  margin-inline-end: 10px;
}
```

In the example above, the `span` elements will have a margin of 10 pixels on the inline-end side, creating space between the elements and the content to their right.

### **Values of `margin-inline-end`:**
- You can use various units (e.g., pixels, em, percentages) to specify the margin spacing on the inline-end side.

### **Why Use `margin-inline-end`?**
The `margin-inline-end` property is used to control the horizontal spacing between an element's inline-end edge and the adjacent content. It allows you to create space between the element and the content to its right in the layout.

### **Where to Use `margin-inline-end`?**
Use the `margin-inline-end` property on inline-level elements (e.g., spans, anchor links) where you want to control the horizontal spacing between the element's inline-end edge and the adjacent content.

### **How to Use `margin-inline-end`:**
1. Decide the desired amount of horizontal space you want between the element and the content to its right.
2. Apply the `margin-inline-end` property to the element, specifying the desired value.
