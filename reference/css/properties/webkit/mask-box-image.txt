The `-webkit-mask-box-image` property is a non-standard CSS property used in older versions of WebKit-based browsers (such as Safari) to set an image as the mask for an element. This image would define both the mask shape and the pattern to be used for masking. The `-webkit-mask-box-image` property allowed developers to create complex masking effects using an image. However, as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, this property is still supported in WebKit-based browsers like Safari, but it's not part of the CSS standard and is not supported in other modern browsers like Chrome or Firefox.

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .masked-element {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-image: url('content-image.png');
    -webkit-mask-box-image: url('mask-image.png'); /* Set the mask box image */
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="masked-element"></div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Why:**
The `-webkit-mask-box-image` property was used to create complex masking effects using an image as the mask for an element. It allowed developers to apply custom shapes and patterns to mask an element's content.

**Where:**
In the context of its historical usage, the `-webkit-mask-box-image` property could be applied to elements to define an image that would serve as both the mask shape and the pattern to be used for masking.

**How:**
The `-webkit-mask-box-image` property used an image URL to specify the mask image to be applied to the element. The image itself defined both the mask shape and the pattern to be used for masking.

**SEO:**
The `-webkit-mask-box-image` property and its usage have no direct impact on SEO, as it's primarily a styling property that affects the visual appearance of the element.

**Additional Notes:**
- `-webkit-mask-box-image` is specific to WebKit-based browsers like Safari and is not part of the CSS standard.
- Creating complex masking effects using images can lead to intricate designs, but be mindful of potential performance impacts, especially with large images.

**Browser Support:**
The `-webkit-mask-box-image` property is supported in older versions of WebKit-based browsers like Safari. It's not supported in other modern browsers like Chrome or Firefox. When using this property, consider providing alternative styles for other browsers or using alternative techniques for broader compatibility.
