The `grid-auto-columns` CSS property is used within a grid layout to set the default size of columns for grid items that are not explicitly placed using the `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` properties. It defines the size of columns that are created implicitly when grid items are added to the grid.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the `grid-auto-columns` property using the provided template:

### **What is `grid-auto-columns`?**
The `grid-auto-columns` property in CSS is used to set the default size of columns for grid items that are created implicitly within a grid container. It specifies the size that columns will have if not explicitly defined using `grid-template-columns`.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `grid-auto-columns` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  grid-auto-columns: value;
}
```

Where `selector` is the target grid container, and `value` represents the desired default size for implicitly created columns.

### **Example:**
```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-auto-columns: 100px;
}
```

In the example above, columns that are implicitly created within `.grid-container` will have a default size of 100 pixels.

### **Why Use `grid-auto-columns`?**
The `grid-auto-columns` property allows you to set a consistent default width for columns that are created implicitly, ensuring a predictable layout when items are added dynamically.

### **Where to Use `grid-auto-columns`?**
Use the `grid-auto-columns` property on a grid container when you want to set the default size for columns that are created automatically.

### **How to Use `grid-auto-columns`:**
1. Determine the desired default width for implicitly created columns.
2. Apply the `grid-auto-columns` property to the grid container.

### **Example Values:**
- `grid-auto-columns: 150px`: Implicitly created columns will have a default width of 150 pixels.

### **SEO Considerations:**
The `grid-auto-columns` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, creating consistent and well-organized layouts using this property can enhance user experience, which indirectly contributes to SEO.

### **Additional Notes:**
- **Implicit vs. Explicit Grid**: Explicit grid columns are defined using `grid-template-columns`, while implicit grid columns are created when items exceed the defined columns.

### **Browser Support:**
The `grid-auto-columns` property is supported in modern browsers that also support CSS Grid Layout.

In summary, the `grid-auto-columns` CSS property is used to set the default size of columns for implicitly created grid items within a grid layout. It's useful for maintaining a consistent layout when items are dynamically added to the grid.
