**CSS Images**

**What:**
CSS can be used to style and manipulate images on web pages. It allows you to control aspects like size, positioning, borders, shadows, and other visual effects for images without needing to edit the image files themselves.

**Example:**
Here's an example of using CSS to style an image:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .styled-image {
    width: 200px;
    border: 2px solid #333;
    box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<img class="styled-image" src="image.jpg" alt="Styled Image">

</body>
</html>
```

**Why:**
Using CSS to style images allows you to maintain separation between content and presentation. It provides greater design flexibility, enhances visual appeal, and reduces the need for image editing software.

**Where:**
CSS image styling can be applied in various contexts:
- Adding borders and shadows to images.
- Adjusting image sizes to fit layout requirements.
- Creating hover effects for images.
- Styling background images.

**How:**
Apply CSS properties like `width`, `height`, `border`, `box-shadow`, `object-fit`, and `background` to style and control the appearance of images.

**SEO:**
CSS image styling itself doesn't directly affect SEO. However, well-styled images can contribute to an improved user experience, potentially increasing user engagement and indirectly influencing SEO.

**Additional Notes:**
- Use `alt` attributes for `<img>` elements to provide descriptive text for accessibility and SEO.
- Use responsive design techniques to ensure images adapt to various screen sizes.
- Consider using image sprites or icon fonts for scalable and efficient icons.

**Browser Support:**
CSS image styling properties are supported by modern browsers. However, some advanced features might have varying levels of support. Always test your styles across different browsers to ensure consistent rendering.
