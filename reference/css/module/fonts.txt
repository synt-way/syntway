**CSS Fonts**

**What:**
CSS fonts refer to the styling and presentation of text on web pages. They allow you to control the typeface, size, weight, style, and other aspects of text rendering to create visually appealing and readable content.

**Example:**
Here's an example of using CSS to style fonts:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: italic;
    color: #333;
  }

  h1 {
    font-family: "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
    font-size: 24px;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: #555;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Heading Example</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph with styled text.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

**Why:**
CSS fonts are essential for maintaining consistent typography and creating a visual hierarchy on your website. By using appropriate fonts, font sizes, and styles, you can improve readability, enhance user experience, and reinforce your brand identity.

**Where:**
CSS fonts are used throughout your web design, including:
- Headings and paragraphs
- Navigation menus
- Buttons and links
- Form elements

**How:**
Use CSS properties like `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `font-style`, `color`, and more to style fonts on your web page.

**SEO:**
While CSS fonts don't directly influence SEO, they play a significant role in user experience. Well-styled fonts improve readability and user engagement, potentially leading to longer time spent on your site, reduced bounce rates, and indirectly affecting SEO.

**Additional Notes:**
- Use web-safe fonts as fallback options in case custom fonts fail to load.
- Consider line height, letter spacing, and text alignment for optimal readability.
- Test fonts on different devices and screen sizes to ensure consistent appearance.

**Browser Support:**
CSS font properties are supported by all modern browsers. However, some advanced features (like variable fonts) might have varying levels of support. Always test your font styles across different browsers to ensure consistent rendering.
