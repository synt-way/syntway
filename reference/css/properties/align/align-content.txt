Certainly! Here's an explanation of the CSS property `align-content`:

**`align-content` Property:**

The `align-content` property in CSS is used within a flex container to control how flex lines are aligned along the cross-axis, when there is extra space in the container. This property is particularly useful when dealing with multi-line flex containers where flex items wrap onto multiple lines.

**Example:**
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: center; /* Align flex lines at the center of the container */
}
```

**Why:**
The `align-content` property provides control over the alignment of flex lines in a multi-line flex container. It's used to ensure that the distribution of space between the lines aligns according to the desired layout.

**Where:**
Apply the `align-content` property to a flex container that has the `flex-wrap` property set to `wrap`, indicating that flex items should wrap onto multiple lines. This is most useful when there's extra space along the cross-axis that needs to be distributed between the lines.

**How:**
Set the value of the `align-content` property to one of the available alignment values, such as `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, and `stretch`.

**SEO:**
The `align-content` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, using it to create well-organized and visually appealing layouts can improve user experience and engagement, indirectly affecting SEO metrics.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `align-content` property applies to multi-line flex containers (where flex items wrap) and works in conjunction with the `flex-wrap` property.
- The behavior of `align-content` depends on the available space, the height of the flex container, and the number of flex lines.
- `stretch` is the default value, which stretches the flex lines to occupy the entire height of the container.

**Browser Support:**
The `align-content` property is supported in modern browsers with flexbox support. Be sure to test across different browsers to ensure consistent rendering, especially if you need to support older browsers.
