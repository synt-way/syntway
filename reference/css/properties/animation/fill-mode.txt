The `animation-fill-mode` property in CSS is used to control the styles applied to an element before and after an animation is played. It determines whether the element retains the styles of the starting keyframe (`from` state) or the ending keyframe (`to` state) of the animation after the animation completes or before it starts.

**Example:**
```css
.slide {
  animation: slide 2s ease-in-out forwards; /* Animation with fill mode set to forwards */
}

@keyframes slide {
  from { transform: translateX(0); }
  to { transform: translateX(100%); }
}
```

**Why:**
The `animation-fill-mode` property is used to control how the element's styles are applied before and after the animation. This can help ensure that the animation's visual changes persist after the animation has completed.

**Where:**
Apply the `animation-fill-mode` property to the element you're animating to control the filling of styles before and after the animation.

**How:**
The `animation-fill-mode` property accepts values like:
- `none`: The element does not retain any styles from the animation.
- `forwards`: The element retains the styles of the ending keyframe after the animation completes.
- `backwards`: The element retains the styles of the starting keyframe before the animation starts.
- `both`: The element retains both the styles of the starting keyframe before the animation and the styles of the ending keyframe after the animation.

**SEO:**
The `animation-fill-mode` property and animations themselves don't have a direct impact on SEO. However, animations can contribute to user engagement and experience, potentially leading to longer page visits.

**Additional Notes:**
- `animation-fill-mode` can be particularly useful when you want to maintain the visual state of an animated element after the animation finishes.
- You can combine `animation-fill-mode` with other animation properties like `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, and `animation-timing-function` to create more complex animations.

**Browser Support:**
The `animation-fill-mode` property is supported in modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It is widely supported and provides consistent behavior across these browsers.
