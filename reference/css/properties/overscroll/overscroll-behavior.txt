**1. What is `overscroll-behavior`?**
   - **Definition:** `overscroll-behavior` is a CSS property that allows you to control the behavior of scrolling when the content reaches the boundaries of an element. It defines how the browser should handle the "rubber-banding" effect and prevent unintended scrolling behaviors.
   - **Syntax:** `overscroll-behavior: value;`

**2. Why Use `overscroll-behavior`?**
   - **Control Scrolling:** It allows you to specify how the browser should react when a user tries to scroll beyond the edges of an element.
   - **Enhance User Experience:** Helps in providing a smoother and more predictable scrolling experience, particularly on touch devices.

**3. Where is `overscroll-behavior` Used?**
   - **Scrollable Elements:** Commonly applied to scrollable containers like divs or elements with overflow scroll/auto and on touch-enabled devices.
   - **Responsive Design:** Useful for handling scrolling behaviors in mobile or responsive web design.

**4. How to Use `overscroll-behavior`?**
   - **Example 1:** Preventing overscroll (no rubber-banding):
     ```css
     .no-overscroll {
       overscroll-behavior: none;
     }
     ```

   - **Example 2:** Allowing overscroll with content snapping back to the container:
     ```css
     .snap-overscroll {
       overscroll-behavior: contain;
     }
     ```

**5. SEO Implications:**
   - `overscroll-behavior` itself does not have a direct impact on SEO. However, it contributes to a smoother and more user-friendly experience, which can indirectly affect user engagement and SEO.

**6. Additional Notes:**

   - **Compatibility:** It's widely supported in modern browsers and can enhance the user experience, particularly on mobile devices.

**7. Browser Support:**
   - `overscroll-behavior` is supported in modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
