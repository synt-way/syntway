The `:any-link` pseudo-class in CSS is a relatively new pseudo-class that is used to target any element that acts as a hyperlink, including anchor (`<a>`) elements, as well as elements with the `role="link"` attribute in HTML. This pseudo-class simplifies the styling of all types of links on a web page, making it easier to create consistent link styles.

**Syntax:**
```css
:any-link {
    /* CSS rules for any link */
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the `:any-link` pseudo-class:

1. **What is the `:any-link` Pseudo-Class in CSS?**
   - The `:any-link` pseudo-class targets any element that behaves as a hyperlink, such as anchor (`<a>`) elements and elements with the `role="link"` attribute. It allows you to apply styles to all links in a consistent manner.

2. **Why Use the `:any-link` Pseudo-Class?**
   - You use the `:any-link` pseudo-class to create consistent link styles for all types of hyperlinks on a web page. This simplifies styling and ensures that links with different HTML elements or roles are styled uniformly.

3. **Where Can You Use the `:any-link` Pseudo-Class?**
   - You can use it in your CSS stylesheets to target and style any type of hyperlink, whether it's an anchor element (`<a>`), a button with a link role, or any other element with a `role="link"` attribute.

4. **How to Use the `:any-link` Pseudo-Class?**
   - To use it, simply use the `:any-link` pseudo-class as a selector, and define the CSS rules inside the curly braces `{}` that follow. These rules will apply to all hyperlink elements.

   ```css
   :any-link {
       color: #0077FF; /* Blue link color for all hyperlinks */
       text-decoration: underline; /* Add underlines to all hyperlinks */
   }
   ```

5. **SEO Considerations:**
   - The `:any-link` pseudo-class itself does not have a direct impact on SEO. It is a styling tool used to maintain consistent link styles across a website. SEO primarily focuses on the content and structure of HTML documents.

6. **Additional Notes:**
   - The `:any-link` pseudo-class simplifies the process of creating consistent link styles. It ensures that all elements acting as links share the same styles, making it easier to manage and maintain link styling.
   - The `:any-link` pseudo-class is particularly useful when designing accessible websites that use elements other than anchor tags for links, such as buttons or custom interactive elements.

7. **Browser Support:**
   - The `:any-link` pseudo-class is supported in modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. However, older browsers may not support it, so be sure to check for compatibility if you need to support older versions.

Here's an example of how you might use the `:any-link` pseudo-class in a CSS stylesheet to style all types of hyperlinks uniformly:

```css
/* Style all hyperlinks uniformly */
:any-link {
    color: #0077FF; /* Blue link color */
    text-decoration: underline; /* Add underlines */
}
```

In this example, all hyperlinks on the web page, whether they are anchor elements (`<a>`), buttons with link roles, or other elements with `role="link"`, will have the same blue color and underline styling.
