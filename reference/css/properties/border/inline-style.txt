As of my last update in September 2021, the property `border-inline-style` is not a standard CSS property. However, if you're attempting to apply a specific border style to an inline element, you can utilize standard `border` properties and pseudo-elements like `::before` or `::after`.

Here's a general example:

```css
/* Apply a custom border-like style to an inline element */
.inline-custom-border::after {
  content: "";
  display: inline-block;
  width: 10px;
  height: 2px;
  border-top: 1px dashed orange; /* Set the desired border style */
  margin-left: 5px; /* Adjust as needed */
}
```

In this example, the `::after` pseudo-element is used to generate a dashed orange line that emulates a border on the inline element with the class `.inline-custom-border`.

Remember, CSS capabilities can evolve, and new features might have emerged after September 2021. Always consult the latest CSS specifications or resources like MDN Web Docs for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
