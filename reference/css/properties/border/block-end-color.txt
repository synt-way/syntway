The `border-block-end-color` property in CSS is used to set the color of the block-level border on the end side of an element. The "end" side is determined by the writing mode of the content, which is typically the right side in a left-to-right writing mode or the left side in a right-to-left writing mode.

**Example:**
```css
.sidebar {
  border-block-end-color: #ff0000; /* Set the color of the border on the end side to red */
}
```

**Why:**
The `border-block-end-color` property is used to control the color of the vertical border on the "end" side of an element. It's particularly useful when you want to apply a specific color to the appropriate side based on the writing mode of the content.

**Where:**
Apply the `border-block-end-color` property to block-level elements where you want to specify the color for the vertical border on the end side (right side in LTR, left side in RTL).

**How:**
Set the value of the `border-block-end-color` property to the desired color, using color keywords, hexadecimal values, RGB values, or other supported color representations.

**SEO:**
The `border-block-end-color` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, using it to visually enhance the layout based on the writing mode can contribute to a better user experience.

**Additional Notes:**
- To set different colors for the individual sides of the block-level element's border, you can use properties like `border-block-start-color`, `border-block-end-color`, `border-inline-start-color`, and `border-inline-end-color`.
- The `border-block-end-color` property is part of the Logical Properties and Values specification, which provides better support for languages that use vertical writing modes.

**Browser Support:**
The `border-block-end-color` property is supported in modern browsers that have implemented the Logical Properties and Values specification. This includes browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Keep in mind that support might be limited in older versions of some browsers.
