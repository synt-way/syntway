**CSS Grid Layout**

**What:**
CSS Grid Layout is a powerful layout system that enables you to create two-dimensional grid-based layouts in a flexible and efficient manner. It allows you to define rows and columns and position content within those grid cells, making complex layouts easier to manage.

**Example:**
Here's an example of using CSS Grid Layout to create a simple grid:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-gap: 10px;
  }

  .grid-item {
    background-color: lightgray;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 3</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 4</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 5</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 6</div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Why:**
CSS Grid Layout is used to create complex and responsive layouts that were traditionally challenging to achieve using older layout methods like floats or positioning. It's particularly useful for creating grid-based designs for web pages and web applications.

**Where:**
CSS Grid Layout is applicable whenever you need to create grid-based layouts, such as:
- Multi-column layouts
- Image galleries
- Masonry-style layouts
- Grids for forms or data tables

**How:**
1. Create a grid container using `display: grid;`.
2. Define the number of rows and columns using properties like `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns`.
3. Position items within the grid using `grid-row` and `grid-column`.

**SEO:**
CSS Grid Layout itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, using Grid Layout to create organized and visually appealing layouts can improve user engagement and indirectly influence SEO.

**Additional Notes:**
- Grid Layout works well in combination with other layout methods like Flexbox.
- Use media queries for responsive designs with Grid Layout.
- The `grid` shorthand property can simplify the syntax for defining both rows and columns.

**Browser Support:**
CSS Grid Layout is supported by modern browsers. However, older browsers might have incomplete or buggy implementations. Always test your grid layouts across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
