The `:autofill` pseudo-class in CSS is used to target form elements (input, textarea, select) that have been automatically filled by the browser's autofill feature. This pseudo-class allows you to style autofill input elements differently from other input elements.

**Syntax:**
```css
input:-webkit-autofill {
    /* CSS rules for autofill input elements in WebKit-based browsers */
}

input:-moz-autofill {
    /* CSS rules for autofill input elements in Mozilla Firefox */
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the `:autofill` pseudo-class:

1. **What is the `:autofill` Pseudo-Class in CSS?**
   - The `:autofill` pseudo-class is used to target form elements that have been automatically filled by the browser's autofill feature. It allows you to apply custom styles to these autofilled elements.

2. **Why Use the `:autofill` Pseudo-Class?**
   - You use the `:autofill` pseudo-class to provide a consistent and visually appealing appearance to autofilled form elements. This helps maintain the design and user experience of your web application even when the browser autofills user data.

3. **Where Can You Use the `:autofill` Pseudo-Class?**
   - You can use it in your CSS stylesheets to target and style autofilled form elements, including input fields, textareas, and select dropdowns.

4. **How to Use the `:autofill` Pseudo-Class?**
   - To use it, you need to specify vendor-specific pseudo-classes for autofill because different browsers have different implementations. For example, WebKit-based browsers use `-webkit-autofill`, and Mozilla Firefox uses `-moz-autofill`. Define the CSS rules inside the curly braces `{}` that follow these pseudo-classes.

   ```css
   /* Style autofilled input elements in WebKit-based browsers */
   input:-webkit-autofill {
       background-color: #ffffcc; /* Yellow background color */
       color: #333; /* Text color */
   }

   /* Style autofilled input elements in Mozilla Firefox */
   input:-moz-autofill {
       background-color: #ffffcc;
       color: #333;
   }
   ```

5. **SEO Considerations:**
   - The `:autofill` pseudo-class itself does not have a direct impact on SEO. It is primarily a styling tool used to enhance the visual appearance of autofilled form elements.

6. **Additional Notes:**
   - The autofill pseudo-class is browser-specific, so you need to use vendor prefixes to target different browsers' implementations.
   - Be cautious when restyling autofilled form elements, as it may affect the user's familiarity with the autofill feature. Ensure that the styling maintains usability and does not confuse users.

7. **Browser Support:**
   - Support for styling autofilled form elements using `:autofill` pseudo-classes varies by browser. As mentioned earlier, you should use `-webkit-autofill` for WebKit-based browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari) and `-moz-autofill` for Mozilla Firefox. Check the documentation and updates for specific browsers to confirm support.

Here's an example of how you might use the `:autofill` pseudo-class in a CSS stylesheet to style autofilled input elements:

```css
/* Style autofilled input elements in Chrome and Safari */
input:-webkit-autofill {
    background-color: #ffffcc; /* Yellow background color */
    color: #333; /* Text color */
}
```

In this example, autofilled input fields in Chrome and Safari will have a yellow background color and dark text color, creating a distinct appearance for autofilled data.
