The `cursor` CSS property is used to define the type of cursor to be displayed when the mouse pointer is positioned over an element. It allows you to provide visual feedback to users about the interactivity or action associated with an element.

Here's an in-depth explanation of the `cursor` property using the provided template:

### **What is `cursor`?**
The `cursor` property in CSS is used to specify the type of cursor that should be displayed when the user hovers the mouse pointer over an element on a web page.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `cursor` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  cursor: value;
}
```

Where `selector` is the target element, and `value` is the desired cursor type.

### **Example:**
```css
.clickable-element {
  cursor: pointer;
}

.text-select-element {
  cursor: text;
}
```

### **Why Use `cursor`?**
The `cursor` property is used to enhance user experience by providing visual cues about how the element will respond to user interaction. It helps users understand which elements are interactive, clickable, or selectable.

### **Where to Use `cursor`?**
Use the `cursor` property on elements that require user interaction, such as links, buttons, and input fields. You can also use it on elements where a specific cursor type conveys additional information to users.

### **How to Use `cursor`:**
1. Choose an appropriate cursor value from the available options.
2. Apply the `cursor` property to the desired elements in your CSS.

### **Example Cursor Values:**
- `auto`: The default browser behavior, where the cursor type is determined based on the context.
- `pointer`: Indicates a clickable element, like a link or button.
- `text`: Indicates selectable text, such as within input fields or text areas.
- `move`: Indicates that the element can be moved.
- `not-allowed`: Indicates that the action is not allowed.

### **SEO Considerations:**
The `cursor` property doesn't directly affect SEO. However, using appropriate cursor types can improve user experience and interactions, which indirectly affects engagement and user satisfaction.

### **Additional Notes:**
- **Custom Cursors**: You can use custom images as cursors using the `url()` function.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Most cursor values are widely supported across modern browsers.

### **Browser Support:**
The `cursor` property is supported in all modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

In summary, the `cursor` CSS property allows you to define the type of cursor to be displayed when the mouse pointer hovers over an element. It's a simple but effective way to provide visual feedback and enhance user experience on interactive elements of a webpage.
