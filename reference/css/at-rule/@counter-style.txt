The `@counter-style` at-rule in CSS is used to define custom counter styles for use with CSS counters. It allows you to create your own custom list styles, which can be used for ordered lists (lists with numbers) or custom counters in CSS. Custom counters can be useful for creating unique list styles or numbering schemes that aren't provided by default by HTML.

Here's a detailed explanation of `@counter-style`:

**Syntax:**
The `@counter-style` at-rule is used to define custom counter styles:

```css
@counter-style identifier {
  /* Counter style properties and descriptors */
}
```

- `identifier`: Specifies a unique name for the custom counter style you are defining.

**Example:**
Let's say you want to create a custom counter style for numbering chapters in a book with Roman numerals. You can define a custom counter style like this:

```css
@counter-style roman {
  system: extended-alpha;
  symbols: "I" "V" "X" "L" "C" "D" "M";
  suffix: " ";
}
```

In this example, we've defined a custom counter style named "roman" that uses Roman numerals. We specify the `system` as "extended-alpha" to use the extended Roman numeral system, provide the symbols for each digit, and add a space as a `suffix` after the numeral.

**Why Use `@counter-style` Rule:**
The `@counter-style` rule allows you to create custom list numbering styles that are not provided by default in HTML. It gives you control over the appearance of counters in ordered lists, making it possible to create unique and visually appealing list styles.

**Where to Use `@counter-style` Rule:**
You should use the `@counter-style` rule in your CSS to define custom counter styles when you need specific numbering schemes or styles for lists in your web documents.

**How `@counter-style` Rule Works:**
The `@counter-style` rule defines the properties and descriptors for a custom counter style. It specifies the numbering system (`system`), the symbols for digits (`symbols`), and optional properties like the `suffix` or `prefix` to format the output of the counter.

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Considerations:**
The use of the `@counter-style` rule does not have a direct impact on SEO. SEO primarily focuses on content, structure, and metadata to improve a website's search engine ranking. However, creating well-structured and readable lists with custom numbering styles can indirectly enhance the user experience and potentially contribute to SEO.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `@counter-style` rule is part of the CSS Counter Styles Level 3 specification and is a powerful tool for creating custom numbering systems.
- Browser support for custom counter styles is generally good in modern browsers, but some older browsers may not fully support this feature. It's important to test and consider fallback styles for unsupported browsers.
- Custom counter styles can be applied to ordered lists (`<ol>`) using the `list-style-type` property in CSS.

**Browser Support:**
Support for the `@counter-style` rule and custom counter styles is available in modern web browsers, but it's essential to test your styles in different browsers and versions to ensure consistent rendering, especially for older browsers.
