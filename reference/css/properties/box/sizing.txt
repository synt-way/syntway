Certainly, let's delve into a comprehensive explanation of the `box-sizing` property in CSS:

**What is `box-sizing`?**
The `box-sizing` property in CSS is used to control how an element's total width and height are calculated, taking into account its padding and border or not.

**Why is `box-sizing` used?**
By default, the width and height of an element in CSS includes only the content area. However, when borders and padding are added, they increase the element's total size. `box-sizing` allows you to control whether the width and height should include padding and border or not.

**How to use `box-sizing`?**
The `box-sizing` property has two main values:

- `content-box`: This is the default value. It calculates the width and height of the content area only, excluding padding and border.

- `border-box`: It calculates the width and height of the entire element, including content, padding, and border. This is particularly useful for more intuitive sizing, as changes to padding and border won't affect the overall dimensions of the element.

Here's an example:

```css
/* Apply box-sizing to an element */
.element {
  box-sizing: border-box; /* or content-box */
  width: 200px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

**Where to use `box-sizing`?**
This property is used within your CSS styles and is commonly applied to elements where you want to control how width and height are calculated.

**SEO Implications:**
The `box-sizing` property itself doesn't have direct SEO implications. SEO primarily focuses on content, keywords, page structure, and meta information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The choice between `content-box` and `border-box` depends on your desired sizing behavior and how you want padding and border to affect an element's dimensions.
- It's often helpful to use `border-box` for consistency and easier layout calculations.

**Browser Support:**
As of my last update in September 2021, `box-sizing` is widely supported in modern browsers. However, browser support for specific features and syntax may vary. Always check the latest compatibility information on websites like MDN Web Docs or Can I use.
