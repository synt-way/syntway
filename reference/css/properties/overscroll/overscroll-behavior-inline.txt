`overscroll-behavior-inline` is a CSS property used to control the behavior of an element when the user tries to scroll past its boundaries in the inline (horizontal) direction. It is similar to `overscroll-behavior-block`, but it applies to horizontal scrolling.

Here's an explanation of the various aspects related to `overscroll-behavior-inline`:

1. **What is `overscroll-behavior-inline`**:
   - `overscroll-behavior-inline` is a CSS property that can be applied to an element to specify how it should behave when the user attempts to scroll beyond its content's boundaries horizontally (in the inline direction).

2. **Why Use `overscroll-behavior-inline`**:
   - It's used to control the user experience when scrolling content horizontally within an element.
   - It helps prevent unwanted behaviors like elastic scrolling or bouncing in the horizontal direction, which can be frustrating for users.
   - It provides more control over the scroll behavior of elements, leading to a smoother and more predictable user experience, especially on touch devices.

3. **Where to Apply `overscroll-behavior-inline`**:
   - You can apply it to any HTML element that has scrollable content in the horizontal direction, such as a horizontally scrolling `<div>` or a wide `<table>`.

4. **How to Use `overscroll-behavior-inline`**:
   - You can apply it in your CSS stylesheets using the following syntax:
   
     ```css
     element {
       overscroll-behavior-inline: value;
     }
     ```

   - Replace `element` with the selector for the HTML element you want to style, and `value` with one of the accepted values explained below.

   - Common values for `overscroll-behavior-inline` include:
     - `auto`: The default behavior. Allows the browser to handle overscrolling as it normally would in the horizontal direction.
     - `contain`: Prevents overscrolling but doesn't prevent horizontal scrolling entirely.
     - `none`: Completely disables overscrolling behavior in the horizontal direction.

5. **SEO Implications**:
   - Similar to `overscroll-behavior-block`, `overscroll-behavior-inline` primarily affects the user experience and doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. It's a visual and interactive property, so it won't directly affect your website's search engine ranking.

6. **Additional Notes**:
   - You can combine `overscroll-behavior-inline` with `overscroll-behavior-block` to control both horizontal and vertical scroll behaviors separately.
   - The property is supported in modern web browsers, but older browsers may not recognize it. Always check for compatibility and consider providing alternative styling or behavior for unsupported browsers.

7. **Browser Support**:
   - As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, `overscroll-behavior-inline` is supported in modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera.
   - Browser support may change over time as new versions are released, so it's essential to check the latest compatibility information on websites like MDN Web Docs or Can I use.

Here's an example of how to use `overscroll-behavior-inline` in CSS:

```css
.horizontal-scroll-container {
  overscroll-behavior-inline: contain;
}
```

In this example, the `.horizontal-scroll-container` element will prevent horizontal overscrolling but still allow scrolling within its boundaries without the usual bouncing or elastic effect in the horizontal direction.
