The `block-size` property in CSS is used to define the height of a block-level element. It specifies the vertical dimension of an element's content box, which is the space occupied by its content, padding, and border.

**Example:**
```css
.article {
  block-size: 300px; /* Set the height of the element to 300 pixels */
}
```

**Why:**
The `block-size` property is used to control the height of block-level elements, allowing you to define the amount of vertical space they occupy within the layout.

**Where:**
Apply the `block-size` property to block-level elements like `div`, `section`, `header`, and others where you want to control their vertical height.

**How:**
Set the value of the `block-size` property to specify the height of the element. You can use length values, percentages, or other units to define the height.

**SEO:**
The `block-size` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, using it to create balanced layouts and consistent spacing can contribute to a better user experience.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `block-size` property defines the height of the content box, which includes the element's content, padding, and border.
- For elements that have intrinsic sizing, such as images and replaced elements, the `block-size` property determines their height.

**Browser Support:**
The `block-size` property is supported in modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It provides consistent behavior across these browsers.
