   - Accessibility: It is crucial for making web content more accessible by providing visible focus indicators for keyboard navigation and screen readers.
   - Design: Allows designers to customize the visual appearance of element outlines.

**3. Where is `outline-color` Used?**
   - Focus States: Typically used on form elements (input fields, buttons) to indicate focus when navigating with the keyboard.

     .custom-outline {

       outline-offset: 5px; /* Adjusts the spacing between the element and the outline */
     }
     ```

**5. SEO Implications:**
   - `outline-color` does not have a direct impact on SEO. It is primarily a styling property that affects the visual presentation of web elements.

**6. Additional Notes:**
   - **Accessibility**: Ensure that any custom outlines provide sufficient contrast and do not obscure content.
   - **Outline Offset**: Use `outline-offset` to control the distance between the outline and the element's border.
   - **Fallback**: Consider using a combination of `outline` and `border` properties for cross-browser compatibility.

   - `outline-color` is well-supported in modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
   - For older versions of Internet Explorer, `outline-color` may not be fully supported. In such cases, fallback techniques like using `border` for outlining should be employed.

In summary, `outline-color` is a CSS property used to set the color of element outlines. It is essential for accessibility and can be customized for design purposes. It is well-supported in modern browsers and should be used alongside other techniques for cross-browser compatibility, especially in older browsers.
