   - Syntax: `outline: [outline-color] [outline-style] [outline-width];`

**2. Why Use `outline`?**
   - **Accessibility:** Primarily used to indicate focus on interactive elements (e.g., links, buttons) for keyboard navigation and screen reader users.
   - **Interactive Highlighting:** Can be applied to highlight elements during user interaction (e.g., hover) without affecting layout.

**5. SEO Implications:**
   - `outline` has no direct impact on SEO. It is a styling property used for user interface design and accessibility.

**6. Additional Notes:**
   - **Accessibility:** Ensure that customized outlines meet contrast requirements and do not obscure content.
   - **Outline vs. Border:** `outline` does not affect the layout and does not take up space within an element, making it suitable for accessibility purposes.
   - **Outline Offset:** Use `outline-offset` to control the distance between the outline and the element's border.
   - **Browser Defaults:** Some browsers apply their own default outline styles to focused elements, but these can be overridden with custom styles.

**7. Browser Support:**
   - `outline` is widely supported across modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
   - It is considered a standard CSS property and is part of CSS2.1 and CSS3 specifications.

In summary, `outline` is a CSS property used to define a visible line around elements, primarily for focus indication and interactive highlighting. It is important for accessibility and widely supported in modern browsers. Customizing outlines can improve user experience, but it does not directly affect SEO.
