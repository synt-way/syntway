As of my last update in September 2021, there's no CSS property named `border-inline-start`. However, if you're trying to achieve a custom visual effect similar to a border on the start (beginning) side of an inline element, you can use pseudo-elements like `::before` to create that effect.

Here's an example of how you might approach this:

```css
/* Apply a custom "border" at the start of an inline element */
.inline-start-border::before {
  content: "";
  display: inline-block;
  width: 10px;
  height: 2px;
  background-color: red; /* Set the desired color */
  margin-right: 5px; /* Adjust as needed */
}
```

In this example, the `::before` pseudo-element is used to add a red horizontal line that could be perceived as a "start border" to the inline element with the class `.inline-start-border`.

Remember, the use of pseudo-elements and custom styling techniques can provide creative visual effects. Keep in mind that CSS capabilities can evolve, and new features might have been introduced after September 2021. Always refer to the latest CSS specifications or resources like MDN Web Docs for accurate and up-to-date information.
