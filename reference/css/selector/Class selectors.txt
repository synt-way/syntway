Class selectors are an essential part of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that allow you to select and style HTML elements based on their class attribute. They are denoted by a period (.) followed by the class name and are used to apply styles to one or more elements with the same class.

**Syntax:**
Class selectors are written using a period (.) followed by the class name:

```css
.class-name {
  /* CSS styles here */
}
```

**Example:**
Let's say you have the following HTML:

```html
<p class="highlight">This is a highlighted paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a regular paragraph.</p>
<p class="highlight">Another highlighted paragraph.</p>
```

You can use class selectors to style elements with the `highlight` class:

```css
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

**Why Use Class Selectors:**
Class selectors are used to apply consistent styles to elements that share a common purpose or appearance. They are particularly useful when you want to style multiple elements in the same way without affecting other elements on the page.

**Where to Use Class Selectors:**
Class selectors can be used in your CSS stylesheets to target and style HTML elements with specific class attributes.

**How Class Selectors Work:**
Class selectors work by selecting all elements that have a matching class attribute. When you apply styles to a class selector, those styles are applied to all elements on the page that have that class.

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Considerations:**
Class selectors themselves do not have a direct impact on SEO. However, they play a crucial role in creating structured and semantic HTML documents. Using meaningful class names can improve the clarity and organization of your code, which indirectly benefits SEO.

**Additional Notes:**
- Class names are case-sensitive in HTML and CSS, so `.highlight` and `.Highlight` are considered different classes.
- You can apply multiple classes to a single HTML element, allowing you to combine styles from multiple class selectors.
- Class selectors are commonly used in conjunction with other selectors to create more specific rules.

**Browser Support:**
Class selectors are supported in all modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer. They are a fundamental part of CSS and have been supported since early versions of web browsers, making them a safe and widely used CSS feature.
