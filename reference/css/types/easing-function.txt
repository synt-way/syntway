It appears you are using angle brackets ("<" and ">") to enclose a term, but the term "easing-function" is typically used in CSS and JavaScript to describe a specific concept related to animations and transitions. Let's discuss easing functions:

**1. What is an Easing Function?**
   - **Definition:** An easing function, also known as a timing function, is used in animations and transitions to control the rate of change of a property's value over time. It determines how an animation accelerates or decelerates between keyframes.
   - **Syntax (CSS):** Easing functions are typically used within CSS animations and transitions like this:
     ```css
     animation: element 1s ease-in-out;
     ```

**2. Why Use Easing Functions?**
   - **Smooth Animations:** Easing functions make animations more visually appealing by controlling the speed and timing of transitions.
   - **Realistic Motion:** They help simulate natural movements, adding realism to user interfaces.

**3. Where are Easing Functions Used?**
   - **Animations:** Applied to CSS animations and transitions to create smoother and more visually pleasing effects.
   - **Web Design:** Used to enhance user experience by providing smooth transitions in web interfaces.

**4. How to Use Easing Functions?**
   - **Example 1:** Using the `ease-in` easing function for a CSS animation:
     ```css
     .animated-element {
       animation: slideIn 1s ease-in;
     }
     ```

   - **Example 2:** Using the `cubic-bezier` easing function for custom control:
     ```css
     .animated-element {
       animation: slideIn 1s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1);
     }
     ```

**5. SEO Implications:**
   - Easing functions themselves do not have a direct impact on SEO. They are primarily related to the user interface and user experience.

**6. Additional Notes:**
   - **Common Easing Functions:** Common easing functions include `linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`, and custom `cubic-bezier` functions.
   - **Custom Easing Functions:** You can create custom easing functions using cubic Bezier curves for precise control over animation timing.
   - **Browser Support:** Easing functions are supported in modern web browsers, but some older browsers may have limited support or require vendor prefixes.

**7. Browser Support:**
   - Easing functions are supported in modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
   - Custom cubic Bezier functions are widely supported but may require vendor prefixes for older browsers.

In summary, easing functions, or timing functions, are used in animations and transitions to control the rate of change of a property's value over time, creating smoother and visually appealing effects. While they don't directly impact SEO, they play a crucial role in enhancing user interfaces and animations on websites and are well-supported in modern browsers.
