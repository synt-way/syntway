### **What is `line-height`?**
The `line-height` property in CSS is used to control the amount of vertical space between lines of text within a block-level element. It defines the distance between the baselines of adjacent lines, affecting the overall spacing and readability of text.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `line-height` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  line-height: value;
}
```

Where `selector` is the target element containing text, and `value` represents the desired line height. The value can be specified in various units such as unitless numbers, percentages (%), pixels (px), em units (em), or other supported length units.

### **Example:**
```css
p {
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

In the example above, the line height within the `p` element will be 1.5 times the font size, creating a comfortable spacing between lines.

### **How to Use `line-height`:**
1. Determine the desired amount of vertical space between lines.
