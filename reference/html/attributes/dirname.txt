The `dirname` attribute is an HTML attribute used with the `<input>` element of type "text" or "search" to provide the directionality of the text entered by the user. It specifies whether the text should be entered and displayed from left to right (LTR) or from right to left (RTL). This attribute is particularly useful for multilingual websites or web applications that support languages with different text directions, such as Arabic or Hebrew.
