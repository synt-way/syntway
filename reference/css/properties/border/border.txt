The `border` property in CSS is a shorthand property used to set the width, style, and color of all four sides of an element's border. It allows you to define the appearance of the borders that surround an element's content.

**Example:**
```css
.box {
  border: 2px solid #000; /* Set a black solid border with a width of 2 pixels */
}
```

**Why:**
The `border` property is used to add visual separation and distinction between elements. Borders are commonly used to provide structure and emphasis to elements in a webpage's layout.

**Where:**
Apply the `border` property to block-level and inline-level elements where you want to create a visible border around the content.

**How:**
The `border` property has three parts that can be specified in any order:
1. Border width: Defines the width of the border in pixels, ems, rems, percentages, etc.
2. Border style: Specifies the style of the border (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted, etc.).
3. Border color: Sets the color of the border.

You can use any combination of these parts to define the appearance of the borders.

**SEO:**
The `border` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, using borders to create a visually structured layout can contribute to a better user experience.

**Additional Notes:**
- If you want to set different styles, widths, and colors for each side of the element's border, you can use individual properties like `border-top`, `border-right`, `border-bottom`, and `border-left`.
- The `border` property can be combined with other border-related properties like `border-radius` for rounded corners and `border-image` for more complex border patterns.

**Browser Support:**
The `border` property is widely supported in all modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It provides consistent behavior across these browsers.
