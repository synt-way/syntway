**1. What is the `<input type="radio">` Element?**
The `<input type="radio">` element is an HTML input element that represents a radio button. Radio buttons allow users to select a single option from a list of mutually exclusive choices.

**2. Why Use the `<input type="radio">` Element?**
The primary purpose of the `<input type="radio">` element is to present users with a set of options and allow them to choose one option from the list. Radio buttons are often used in scenarios where users need to make a single selection, such as choosing a gender, selecting a payment method, or indicating a preference.

**3. Where Can the `<input type="radio">` Element Be Used?**
The `<input type="radio">` element can be used within HTML forms and is suitable for situations where users need to choose one option from a predefined list of options.

**4. How to Use the `<input type="radio">` Element?**
Here's an example of how the `<input type="radio">` element can be used:

```html
<form action="survey.php" method="post">
  <label>Gender:</label>
  <input type="radio" id="male" name="gender" value="male">
  <label for="male">Male</label>
  <input type="radio" id="female" name="gender" value="female">
  <label for="female">Female</label>
  <input type="radio" id="other" name="gender" value="other">
  <label for="other">Other</label>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

In this example, users can select their gender using radio buttons. Only one option can be selected at a time due to the mutually exclusive nature of radio buttons.
