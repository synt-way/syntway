### **What is `grid-template-areas`?**
The `grid-template-areas` property in CSS is used to visually define the arrangement of grid items within a grid container using named grid areas. It allows you to specify the structure of the grid layout using a visual representation.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `grid-template-areas` property is as follows:

Where `selector` is the target grid container, and each row of strings represents a row of grid areas.

  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header"
    "sidebar content content"
    "footer footer footer";
}
