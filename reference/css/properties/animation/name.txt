The `animation-name` property in CSS is used to specify the name of an animation defined using `@keyframes`. It associates the element with the set of keyframes that define the animation's behavior. This property is a crucial part of creating animations on web pages.

**Example:**
```css
.slide {
  animation-name: slide-animation; /* Apply the slide-animation keyframes to this element */
  animation-duration: 1s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
}

@keyframes slide-animation {
  from { transform: translateX(0); }
  to { transform: translateX(100%); }
}
```

**Why:**
The `animation-name` property is used to apply a specific set of keyframes to an element, defining the animation's behavior. This separation allows for reusability and organization of animations in CSS.

**Where:**
Apply the `animation-name` property to the element you're animating to associate it with the defined keyframes.

**How:**
The `animation-name` property accepts the name of a defined `@keyframes` animation that you want to apply to the element.

**SEO:**
The `animation-name` property and animations themselves don't have a direct impact on SEO. However, well-designed animations can enhance user experience and engagement.

**Additional Notes:**
- You can combine `animation-name` with other animation properties like `animation-duration`, `animation-timing-function`, and `animation-iteration-count` to create more complex animations.
- You can apply multiple animations to the same element by separating animation names with commas.

**Browser Support:**
The `animation-name` property is supported in modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It is widely supported and provides consistent behavior across these browsers.
