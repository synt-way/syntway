**1. What is the `<input type="image">` Element?**
The `<input type="image">` element is an HTML input element that allows you to create an image-based submit button within a form. When a user clicks on the image, the form is submitted to the server, and the coordinates of the click are sent as form data.

**2. Why Use the `<input type="image">` Element?**
The primary use of the `<input type="image">` element is to create a clickable image that submits a form. This is often used in scenarios where you want to create a visual representation of a submit action, such as using an image of a "Search" button in a search form.

**3. Where Can the `<input type="image">` Element Be Used?**
The `<input type="image">` element is used within HTML forms and can be placed wherever you would use a submit button.

```html
<form action="submit.php" method="post">
  <input type="image" src="search-icon.png" alt="Search">
</form>
```

In this example, an image of a search icon is used as the submit button for the form. When the user clicks on the image, the form is submitted to the server.
