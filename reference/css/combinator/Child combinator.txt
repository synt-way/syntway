The child combinator in CSS is represented by the `>` symbol and is used to select elements that are a direct child of a specified parent element. This combinator allows you to target elements that are directly nested within another element, without selecting elements that are nested further down the hierarchy.

**Syntax:**
```css
parent > child {
    /* CSS rules for direct child elements */
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the child combinator:

1. **What is the Child Combinator?**
   - The child combinator is a CSS selector that selects elements that are direct children of a specified parent element. It's denoted by the `>` symbol.

2. **Why Use the Child Combinator?**
   - You use the child combinator when you want to apply styles to elements that are immediate children of a specific parent, without selecting nested descendants. This allows for more precise targeting of elements in your HTML structure.

3. **Where Can You Use the Child Combinator?**
   - You can use it in your CSS stylesheets to select and style elements based on their direct parent-child relationship. It's particularly useful when you want to avoid selecting elements nested deeper in the hierarchy.

4. **How to Use the Child Combinator?**
   - To use it, specify a parent element (the container) followed by the `>` symbol and then the child element you want to target. CSS rules specified inside the curly braces will apply to the child elements that are direct descendants of the specified parent.

   ```css
   ul > li {
       /* Styles for <li> elements that are direct children of <ul> elements */
   }
   ```

5. **SEO Considerations:**
   - Like other CSS selectors, the child combinator itself does not have a direct impact on SEO. However, it can help improve the presentation and structure of your content, which indirectly contributes to a better user experience.

6. **Additional Notes:**
   - Be cautious with the child combinator, as it selects only direct children. If you need to select elements at any level of nesting within a parent, consider using descendant selectors (space) instead.

7. **Browser Support:**
   - The child combinator is widely supported in modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It is a core part of the CSS specification and is compatible with older versions of browsers as well.

Here's an example of how you might use the child combinator in a CSS stylesheet:

```css
/* Select all <li> elements that are direct children of <ul> elements */
ul > li {
    list-style-type: square;
}
```

In this example, the CSS rule will apply to `<li>` elements that are direct children of `<ul>` elements, styling them with square bullets. Nested `<li>` elements within deeper levels of nesting will not be affected by this rule.
