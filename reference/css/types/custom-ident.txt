The term `<custom-ident>` is a placeholder used in the CSS specification to refer to custom identifiers or custom names that can be defined by developers. Custom identifiers are essentially user-defined names that can be used in various CSS properties. Let's delve into the concept of `<custom-ident>` in CSS:

**What is `<custom-ident>` in CSS?**
- `<custom-ident>` represents custom identifiers or custom names that developers can define and use in their CSS code. These custom names are user-defined and can be used as values for certain CSS properties.

**Why are custom identifiers used in CSS?**
- Custom identifiers are used to make CSS more flexible and allow developers to create their own reusable values. They are particularly useful when working with CSS custom properties (variables) to define and reuse values throughout a stylesheet.

**Where are custom identifiers used in CSS?**
- Custom identifiers can be used as values for CSS custom properties (variables) and certain other CSS properties that accept custom names.

**How to use `<custom-ident>` with examples (in CSS):**
Here's an example of how to define and use a custom identifier in CSS, particularly with custom properties:

1. Define a custom property with a custom identifier:

```css
/* Define a custom property with a custom identifier */
:root {
  --primary-color: blue;
}
```

In this example, we define a custom property `--primary-color` and set its value to `blue`.

2. Use the custom identifier in CSS rules:

```css
/* Use the custom identifier in CSS rules */
.element {
  color: var(--primary-color);
  background-color: var(--background-color, #ffffff); /* Using a fallback value */
}
```

In this example, we use the custom identifier `--primary-color` as a value for the `color` property.

**SEO implications:**
The use of custom identifiers itself does not have a direct impact on SEO (Search Engine Optimization). SEO primarily involves optimizing content, meta tags, and other factors to improve a website's visibility in search engine results. However, the use of custom identifiers can contribute to better maintainability and organization of CSS code, indirectly impacting development efficiency and code quality.

**Additional Notes:**
- Custom identifiers are commonly used with CSS custom properties (variables) to create reusable and configurable styles.
- Custom identifiers should follow CSS naming conventions and be chosen to reflect their purpose clearly in the stylesheet.
- While custom identifiers are versatile, they should be used judiciously to maintain code readability and avoid excessive complexity.

**Browser Support:**
Support for custom identifiers in CSS is generally good, as they are a fundamental part of using custom properties. However, support for custom properties themselves (variations of CSS variables) may vary in older browsers, so it's essential to test and ensure compatibility when using custom identifiers extensively. Modern web browsers support custom properties and custom identifiers well.
