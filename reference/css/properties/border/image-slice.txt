Certainly, I'd be happy to explain the `border-image-slice` property in more detail:

**What is `border-image-slice`?**
`border-image-slice` is a CSS property that is used to define how a border image is sliced into sections in order to create a border with an image. It allows you to specify the widths of the slices along the four sides of the element's border, which determines how the image is distributed and repeated to create the border effect.

**Why is `border-image-slice` used?**
When you use an image as a border for an element, you often want to control how the image is divided to create the border pattern. The `border-image-slice` property lets you define these divisions, ensuring that the image behaves correctly when repeated across the border.

**How to use `border-image-slice`?**
The syntax for the `border-image-slice` property is as follows:

```css
element {
  border-image-slice: [top] [right] [bottom] [left];
}
```

You provide one to four values, where:
- `top` sets the width of the top slice,
- `right` sets the width of the right slice,
- `bottom` sets the width of the bottom slice,
- `left` sets the width of the left slice.

You can use any valid CSS length value for these parameters, or you can use the keyword `fill` to indicate that the slice should stretch to fill the available space.

Here's an example:

```css
/* Apply a border image with sliced sections */
.element {
  border-image-source: url(border-image.png);
  border-image-slice: 10% 20% 30% 40%;
  border-image-width: 10px;
}
```

In this example, the border image will be sliced into sections as 10% for the top, 20% for the right, 30% for the bottom, and 40% for the left side of the element's border.

**Additional Notes:**
- The sum of the values may affect the overall display of the border image, especially if it exceeds the dimensions of the image.
- Using different slice values can lead to creative border effects, such as emphasizing one side of the border or creating irregular patterns.
- The `border-image-slice` property is typically used in conjunction with `border-image-source` and `border-image-width` to achieve the desired visual result.

**Browser Support:**
As of my last update in September 2021, `border-image-slice` is well-supported in modern browsers. However, always consider checking the latest browser compatibility data on sites like MDN Web Docs or Can I use for the most current information.
