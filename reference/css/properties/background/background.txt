The `background` property in CSS is a shorthand property that allows you to set multiple background-related properties for an element in a single declaration. It encompasses properties like background-color, background-image, background-repeat, background-position, and more, providing comprehensive control over the background styling of an element.

**Example:**
```css
.element {
  background: #007bff url('image.jpg') no-repeat center center;
}
```

**Why:**
The `background` property is used to efficiently and concisely set various background-related properties for an element. It helps create visually appealing designs by customizing background colors, images, positioning, and other attributes.

**Where:**
Apply the `background` property to elements that require background styling, such as divs, sections, and headers, to enhance their visual presentation.

**How:**
The `background` property can take multiple values in a specific order, separated by spaces:
1. Background color: `background-color`
2. Background image: `background-image`
3. Background repeat: `background-repeat`
4. Background attachment: `background-attachment`
5. Background position: `background-position`

**SEO:**
The `background` property itself doesn't directly impact SEO. However, it contributes to the overall visual design and user experience, which can indirectly influence user engagement and retention.

**Additional Notes:**
- The order of values in the `background` shorthand property matters. If a value is omitted, it takes the default value.
- You can use `none` for properties like `background-image` to indicate no image.
- You can set multiple background images using the `background-image` property with comma separation.
- Using the `background` property can simplify your CSS code, making it easier to manage background-related styles.

**Browser Support:**
The `background` property is widely supported in modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It provides consistent behavior across these browsers. However, always test your designs in different browsers to ensure compatibility.
