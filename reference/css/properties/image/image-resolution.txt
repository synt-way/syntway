I apologize for any confusion, but as of my last update in September 2021, the CSS property `image-resolution` is not a standard property. However, I can provide you with information related to high-resolution images, which might be what you are looking for.

### **High-Resolution Images**

#### **What is High-Resolution Images?**
High-resolution images refer to images with a higher pixel density, often used to provide a better visual experience on devices with high-DPI (dots per inch) screens, such as Retina displays.

#### **Why Use High-Resolution Images?**
Using high-resolution images enhances the visual quality of content on high-DPI screens, resulting in sharper and more detailed images. This improves the overall user experience and visual appeal of a website.

#### **Where to Use High-Resolution Images?**
Use high-resolution images in situations where you want to provide better image quality on devices with high-DPI screens. Common use cases include images in hero sections, product displays, and any visually prominent areas.

#### **How to Use High-Resolution Images:**
1. Create high-resolution versions of your images with double the pixel density (e.g., 2x or 3x) compared to regular images.
2. Use media queries or responsive image techniques to serve the appropriate image based on the device's pixel density.

#### **Example:**
```html
<img src="image.jpg" srcset="image@2x.jpg 2x, image@3x.jpg 3x" alt="High-Res Image">
```

#### **SEO Considerations:**
Using high-resolution images doesn't directly impact SEO. However, a visually appealing website can lead to better user engagement, indirectly affecting SEO.

#### **Additional Notes:**
- **File Size**: High-resolution images may have larger file sizes, which can affect page load times. Use image compression techniques to optimize file sizes.
- **Responsive Design**: Combine high-resolution images with responsive design practices to ensure the images adapt well to different screen sizes.

#### **Browser Support:**
Support for high-resolution images is generally good, especially in modern browsers. However, it's important to test your website on various devices to ensure images display correctly.
