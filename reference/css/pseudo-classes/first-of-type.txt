The `:first-of-type` pseudo-class in CSS is used to select and style the first element of a specified type within its parent container. It allows you to target and apply styles to the first occurrence of a particular element type within a parent context.

**Syntax:**
```css
selector:first-of-type {
    /* CSS rules for the first occurrence of the specified element type */
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the `:first-of-type` pseudo-class:

1. **What is the `:first-of-type` Pseudo-Class in CSS?**
   - The `:first-of-type` pseudo-class selects and styles the first occurrence of a specific type of element within its parent container. It targets the initial element of that type within the parent's context.

2. **Why Use the `:first-of-type` Pseudo-Class?**
   - You use the `:first-of-type` pseudo-class to apply specific styles to the first occurrence of a particular element type among its siblings within a parent container. It's useful for creating unique styles for the initial element of a specific type.

3. **Where Can You Use the `:first-of-type` Pseudo-Class?**
   - You can use it in your CSS stylesheets to target and style the first occurrence of a specific element type within various HTML structures, including lists, paragraphs, headings, and more.

   - Keep in mind that `:first-of-type` selects elements based on their type within the parent's context, not their visual placement on the page.

7. **Browser Support:**
   - Browser support for the `:first-of-type` pseudo-class is generally good and widely supported in modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It is a standard CSS pseudo-class and is compatible with older browser versions as well.

Here's an example of how you might use the `:first-of-type` pseudo-class in a CSS stylesheet to make the first paragraph in an article bold:

```css
/* Make the first paragraph in an article bold */
article p:first-of-type {
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

In this example, the first `<p>` element within an `<article>` element will have its text displayed in bold font weight, distinguishing it from other paragraphs within the same article.
