The `offset-rotate` CSS property is used to control the rotation of an element along a defined motion path when using the `offset-path` property. It allows you to adjust the orientation of an element as it moves along the path, creating dynamic and visually interesting animations.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the `offset-rotate` property using the provided template:

### **What is `offset-rotate`?**
The `offset-rotate` property in CSS is used to adjust the rotation of an element as it moves along a defined motion path. It's used in conjunction with the `offset-path` property to create dynamic animations with rotating elements.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `offset-rotate` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  offset-rotate: auto | angle | auto angle;
}
```

Where `selector` is the target element, `auto` specifies that the element's rotation is determined by the tangent of the path, and `angle` represents the rotation angle in degrees.

### **Example:**
```css
.animated-element {
  offset-path: path('M10 80 Q 95 10 180 80');
  offset-rotate: auto 45deg;
}
```

In the example above, the `.animated-element` is moved along a quadratic Bezier curve path using the `offset-path` property. The `offset-rotate` property is set to rotate the element automatically based on the path's tangent and an additional 45-degree rotation.

### **Values of `offset-rotate`:**
- `auto`: The element's rotation is determined by the tangent of the path, creating a smooth rotation effect.
- `angle`: Specifies a rotation angle in degrees. Positive values rotate the element clockwise, and negative values rotate it counterclockwise.

### **Why Use `offset-rotate`?**
The `offset-rotate` property is used to add rotation to elements that are animated along a motion path. This rotation can enhance the visual appeal of animations and create more dynamic effects.

### **Where to Use `offset-rotate`?**
Use the `offset-rotate` property on elements that are animated along a motion path using the `offset-path` property and need rotation as they move.

### **How to Use `offset-rotate`:**
1. Determine whether you want automatic rotation or a specific rotation angle.
2. Apply the `offset-rotate` property to the target element.

### **Example Values:**
- `offset-rotate: auto;`: Rotates the element automatically based on the path's tangent.
- `offset-rotate: 30deg;`: Rotates the element 30 degrees clockwise.

### **SEO Considerations:**
The `offset-rotate` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. It's primarily used for visual animations and effects.

### **Additional Notes:**
- The `offset-rotate` property is often used in combination with the `offset-path` property and other animation properties.
- It can be particularly useful for creating spinning or revolving animations along curved paths.

### **Browser Support:**
The `offset-rotate` property is supported in modern browsers that support the `offset-path` property and motion path animations. Browser compatibility may vary, so it's important to test your animations across different browsers.
