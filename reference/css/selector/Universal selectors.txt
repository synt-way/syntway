Universal selectors are a type of selector in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that allow you to select and apply styles to all elements on a webpage regardless of their type. They are denoted by an asterisk (*) and are used to target every element within a specified scope.

**Syntax:**
Universal selectors are written using an asterisk (*), often followed by other selectors to limit their scope:

```css
* {
  /* CSS styles here */
}
```

**Example:**
Let's say you have the following HTML:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<h1>This is a heading.</h1>
<ul>
  <li>List item 1</li>
  <li>List item 2</li>
</ul>
```

You can use a universal selector to apply styles to all elements on the page:

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

This example sets the margin and padding of all elements to zero.

**Why Use Universal Selectors:**
Universal selectors are used when you want to apply styles or modify properties for all elements within a specific scope, often to create a consistent and uniform look or to reset default browser styles.

**Where to Use Universal Selectors:**
Universal selectors can be used in your CSS stylesheets to target and style all elements within a specified context, such as within a particular container or the entire page.

**How Universal Selectors Work:**
Universal selectors select all elements within the specified scope. When you apply styles to a universal selector, those styles are applied to all elements, regardless of their type.

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Considerations:**
Using universal selectors itself does not have a direct impact on SEO. However, be cautious when applying styles to all elements, as it can lead to unintended consequences and affect the readability and accessibility of your website. It's essential to use universal selectors judiciously and with clear intent.

**Additional Notes:**
- Universal selectors can be combined with other selectors to target specific elements within a broader scope. For example, `ul *` would target all elements within unordered lists.
- Be cautious when using universal selectors to reset or override default browser styles, as it can affect the rendering of standard HTML elements.
- Universal selectors are sometimes used in CSS resets to normalize the default styling of HTML elements across different browsers.

**Browser Support:**
Universal selectors are supported in all modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer. They are a fundamental feature of CSS and have been supported since the early days of web development.
