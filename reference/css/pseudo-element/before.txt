The `::before` pseudo-element is a powerful feature in CSS that allows you to insert content before the content of an HTML element. It is used to create additional content that is not present in the HTML structure but is rendered on the webpage.

**Syntax:**
The `::before` pseudo-element is added to the beginning of a CSS rule and is preceded by the `::before` keyword:

```css
selector::before {
  /* CSS styles and content here */
  content: "Some content";
}
```

**Example:**
Let's say you have the following HTML:

```html
<div class="quote">
  This is a quote.
</div>
```

You can use the `::before` pseudo-element to add quotation marks before the content of the `.quote` element:

```css
.quote::before {
  content: " \"";
}
```

This CSS rule will insert a double quotation mark (`"`) before the content of the `.quote` element.

**Why Use `::before` Pseudo-Element:**
The `::before` pseudo-element is used to add decorative content, such as icons, symbols, or additional text, to HTML elements without modifying the actual HTML content. It is commonly used for styling and enhancing the visual presentation of elements.

**Where to Use `::before` Pseudo-Element:**
You can use the `::before` pseudo-element in your CSS stylesheets to add content before specific HTML elements.

**How `::before` Pseudo-Element Works:**
The `::before` pseudo-element generates content before the content of the selected element. You can use the `content` property to define the content to be inserted. The added content is part of the element's box and can be styled like any other element.

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Considerations:**
The `::before` pseudo-element itself does not have a direct impact on SEO, as it does not affect the actual content of the webpage. However, it can be used to enhance the presentation of content, making it more appealing to users, which can indirectly benefit SEO by improving user engagement.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `::before` pseudo-element can be used in combination with other CSS properties, such as `content`, `display`, `position`, and `color`, to control the appearance and behavior of the generated content.
- The `::after` pseudo-element is a similar concept but inserts content after the content of an element.
- Be aware of accessibility considerations when using `::before` to insert content, as screen readers may not recognize generated content.

**Browser Support:**
The `::before` pseudo-element is well-supported in modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 8 and later. It is a widely used and standard feature of CSS.
