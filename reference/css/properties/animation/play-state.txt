The `animation-play-state` property in CSS is used to control the playback state of an animation. It allows you to pause or resume an animation, providing dynamic control over when animations are active or paused.

**Example:**
```css
.pause-button:hover .spin {
  animation-play-state: paused; /* Pause the animation when hovering over the button */
}

.spin {
  animation: spin 2s linear infinite; /* Animation that spins infinitely */
}

@keyframes spin {
  from { transform: rotate(0); }
  to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
```

**Why:**
The `animation-play-state` property is used to control the dynamic behavior of animations. It's particularly useful for interactive animations that respond to user actions.

**Where:**
Apply the `animation-play-state` property to the element with the animation to control its playback state.

**How:**
The `animation-play-state` property accepts values like:
- `running`: The animation is playing.
- `paused`: The animation is paused and does not progress.

**SEO:**
The `animation-play-state` property and animations themselves don't have a direct impact on SEO. However, using animations judiciously can contribute to user engagement and experience.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `animation-play-state` property can be toggled using JavaScript to create dynamic animation controls.
- It's often used in conjunction with interactive elements like buttons to provide user control over animations.
- When an animation is paused, the element retains its style from the point where it was paused.

**Browser Support:**
The `animation-play-state` property is supported in modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It is widely supported and provides consistent behavior across these browsers.
