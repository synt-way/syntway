The `-webkit-text-stroke-width` property is a non-standard CSS property used in older versions of WebKit-based browsers (such as Safari) to specify the width of the stroke applied to the text characters within an element using the `-webkit-text-stroke` property. This property allows developers to control the thickness of the stroke that outlines the text. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, this property is still supported in WebKit-based browsers like Safari, but it's not part of the CSS standard and is not supported in other modern browsers like Chrome or Firefox.

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .outlined-text {
    -webkit-text-stroke: 2px; /* Set the stroke width */
    -webkit-text-stroke-color: black; /* Set the stroke color */
    color: white; /* Set the text color */
    font-size: 24px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p class="outlined-text">
  This text has a 2px outline.
</p>

</body>
</html>
```

**Why:**
The `-webkit-text-stroke-width` property is used to specify the width of the stroke applied to the text characters within an element. This allows developers to create outlined or bordered text effects and control the thickness of the stroke.

**Where:**
In the context of its historical usage, the `-webkit-text-stroke-width` property can be applied to elements containing text content where a specific stroke width for the outline is desired.

**How:**
The `-webkit-text-stroke-width` property accepts values in pixels or other length units to specify the width of the stroke applied to the text.

**SEO:**
The `-webkit-text-stroke-width` property and its usage have no direct impact on SEO, as it's primarily a styling property that affects the visual appearance of text content.

**Additional Notes:**
- `-webkit-text-stroke-width` is specific to WebKit-based browsers like Safari and is not part of the CSS standard.
- When using this property, it's important to consider the overall design and readability of the text, as excessively thick strokes can make the text harder to read.

**Browser Support:**
The `-webkit-text-stroke-width` property is supported in older versions of WebKit-based browsers like Safari. It's not supported in other modern browsers like Chrome or Firefox. When using this property, consider providing alternative styles for other browsers or using other techniques for broader compatibility.
