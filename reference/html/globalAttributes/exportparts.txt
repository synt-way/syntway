As of my last update in September 2021, the "exportparts" property is not a standard HTML attribute, but rather a feature associated with the Web Components specification. It allows developers to expose specific parts of a custom web component's shadow DOM to be stylable from the outside using CSS.

Here's an explanation of "exportparts" based on the information available up until September 2021:

**What is the "exportparts" Property?**
The "exportparts" property is used in custom web components to define named parts of the component's shadow DOM that can be targeted and styled using CSS from outside the shadow DOM.

**Why Use the "exportparts" Property?**
The "exportparts" property enables developers to provide more control over the styling of custom web components while encapsulating their internal structure and implementation details. It enhances reusability and separation of concerns.

**Where is the "exportparts" Property Used?**
The "exportparts" property is used within a custom web component's JavaScript code. It's typically part of the class definition for the web component.

**How to Use the "exportparts" Property?**
In a custom web component, you define the "exportparts" property as an array of strings representing the named parts that you want to expose for styling. Here's a simplified example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    const shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
    shadow.innerHTML = `
      <div class="container">
        <div class="inner" part="my-inner">Content</div>
      </div>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('my-component', MyComponent);
```

In this example, the `part="my-inner"` attribute is used to expose the internal "inner" element as a stylable part of the component.

**SEO and "exportparts":**
As of my last update, the "exportparts" property primarily affects styling and user interface behavior rather than having a direct impact on SEO.

**Additional Notes:**
- "exportparts" is closely related to the concept of Web Components, which is a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create custom, reusable HTML elements.
- The feature enhances the encapsulation of components while providing a mechanism to style specific parts from outside.
- Browser support for Web Components, including features like "exportparts," may vary. Modern browsers generally support these features, but it's important to test in different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.

Please note that developments in web technologies can occur after my last update in September 2021. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about "exportparts" and its usage, consult the latest web standards documentation and browser resources.
