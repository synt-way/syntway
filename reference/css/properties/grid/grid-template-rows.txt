The `grid-template-rows` CSS property is used within a grid layout to define the size and structure of the rows in a grid container. It allows you to specify the height of each row or use flexible units like fractions and percentages.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the `grid-template-rows` property using the provided template:

### **What is `grid-template-rows`?**
The `grid-template-rows` property in CSS is used to define the size and structure of rows within a grid container. It determines how many rows the grid should have and how tall each row should be.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `grid-template-rows` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  grid-template-rows: value1 value2 ...;
}
```

Where `selector` is the target grid container, and `value1`, `value2`, etc., represent the sizes of the individual rows.

### **Example:**
```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 1fr 150px;
}
```

In the example above, the `.grid-container` has three rows: the first row has a fixed height of 100 pixels, the second row takes up one fraction of the available space (1fr), and the third row has a fixed height of 150 pixels.

### **Why Use `grid-template-rows`?**
The `grid-template-rows` property allows you to define the structure and sizing of rows within a grid layout, helping you create flexible and responsive grid-based designs.

### **Where to Use `grid-template-rows`?**
Use the `grid-template-rows` property on a grid container when you want to set the height and arrangement of rows.

### **How to Use `grid-template-rows`:**
1. Determine the desired size for each row (e.g., fixed height, fraction, percentage).
2. Apply the `grid-template-rows` property to the grid container, specifying the sizes for each row.

### **Example Values:**
- `grid-template-rows: 200px 1fr 20%`: The grid has three rows with fixed height, one fraction, and 20% height, respectively.
- `grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 25%)`: The grid has four rows, each with 25% height.

### **SEO Considerations:**
The `grid-template-rows` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, using it to create well-organized and responsive layouts can enhance user experience, indirectly contributing to SEO.

### **Additional Notes:**
- **Flexible Units**: In addition to fixed heights, you can use flexible units like fractions (`fr`) and percentages (%).
- **Auto Sizing**: You can use the `auto` keyword to let rows size themselves based on content.

### **Browser Support:**
The `grid-template-rows` property is supported in modern browsers that also support CSS Grid Layout.

In summary, the `grid-template-rows` CSS property is used to define the size and structure of rows within a grid layout. It's a crucial tool for creating flexible and responsive grid-based designs.
