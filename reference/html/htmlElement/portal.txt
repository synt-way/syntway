As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the `<portal>` element is an experimental feature that allows web developers to create and manage a "portal" between an embedded iframe and the main document. It's designed to improve the performance of certain user interactions by allowing the pre-rendering of content within the iframe before it's actually needed, reducing latency.

However, please note that the information I provide here may not be up-to-date with the latest developments. I recommend checking the latest web specifications and browser documentation for the most accurate and current information regarding the `<portal>` element.

Here's a general explanation based on my last update:

**1. What is the `<portal>` Element?**
The `<portal>` element is an experimental HTML element that allows you to create a connection between a main document and a pre-rendered iframe, referred to as a "portal." This connection allows you to improve the performance of interactions that involve navigating to or interacting with content within the iframe.

**2. Why Use the `<portal>` Element?**
The `<portal>` element aims to enhance the user experience by pre-rendering content in an iframe and maintaining a connection to that content. This can help reduce latency when the user interacts with the portal.

**3. Where Can the `<portal>` Element Be Used?**
The `<portal>` element can be used within the `<body>` of an HTML document to create a portal between an iframe and the main document.

**4. How to Use the `<portal>` Element?**
As of my last update, the exact usage of the `<portal>` element might have changed. However, here's a basic example based on my last knowledge update:

```html
<portal src="external-content.html">
  <!-- Content to be shown while pre-loading -->
  <p>Loading...</p>
</portal>
```

**5. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and `<portal>` Elements:**
The impact of the `<portal>` element on SEO is likely minimal, as it's intended to improve performance rather than directly affecting the content of the page.

**6. Additional Notes:**
- Experimental: The `<portal>` element is an experimental technology, and its behavior might change as it gets refined and standardized.
- Browser Support: As of my last update, support for the `<portal>` element is limited and might require specific browser flags or settings.

**7. Browser Support:**
Support for the `<portal>` element may vary among different browsers and versions. It's important to check the latest browser documentation for information on its current support status and usage.

Keep in mind that because the `<portal>` element is an experimental feature, the information I provide here might be outdated or subject to change. I recommend referring to the latest web specifications and browser documentation for the most accurate and current information.
