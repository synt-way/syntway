The `isolation` CSS property is used to specify whether an element should create a new stacking context. Stacking context affects the way elements are layered and displayed on the z-axis within a web page. This property is often used to prevent elements within a container from affecting or being affected by elements outside that container in terms of stacking order and certain rendering properties.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the `isolation` property using the provided template:

### **What is `isolation`?**
The `isolation` property in CSS determines whether an element creates a new stacking context. Stacking contexts play a significant role in controlling how elements are positioned and layered in the z-axis within the document's rendering flow.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `isolation` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  isolation: auto | isolate;
}
```

Where `selector` is the target element, and the values can be either:
- `auto`: The default value. The element does not create a new stacking context.
- `isolate`: The element creates a new stacking context.

### **Example:**
```css
.container {
  isolation: isolate;
}
```

In the example above, the elements within the `.container` element will create a new stacking context.

### **Why Use `isolation`?**
The `isolation` property is used to manage stacking contexts, allowing you to control how elements are layered and displayed in relation to each other on the z-axis. It can help prevent elements inside a container from affecting or being affected by elements outside the container.

### **Where to Use `isolation`?**
Use the `isolation` property on containers or specific elements within which you want to create a new stacking context, isolating them from the stacking context of their parent or sibling elements.

### **How to Use `isolation`:**
1. Decide whether you want to create a new stacking context for a specific element or container.
2. Apply the `isolation` property with the appropriate value (`auto` or `isolate`) to the target element.

### **Example Values:**
- `isolation: auto;`: The element doesn't create a new stacking context (default behavior).
- `isolation: isolate;`: The element creates a new stacking context.

### **SEO Considerations:**
The `isolation` property doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. Its primary purpose is to control rendering and layering behavior, which may indirectly affect user experience and layout presentation.

### **Additional Notes:**
- Elements with a new stacking context are positioned independently in relation to elements outside that context.
- New stacking contexts can affect stacking order, which determines how elements are displayed in front of or behind other elements.

### **Browser Support:**
The `isolation` property is supported in modern browsers.

In summary, the `isolation` CSS property is used to control whether an element creates a new stacking context, affecting how elements are layered and displayed on the z-axis. It's a useful tool for managing the visual hierarchy of elements within a web page.
