### **What is `justify-content`?**
The `justify-content` property in CSS is used to align flex items along the main axis of a flex container. It defines how the available space is distributed between and around flex items to achieve the desired horizontal alignment.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `justify-content` property is as follows:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;

- `space-around`: Flex items are evenly distributed along the main axis with equal space on both sides.
- `space-evenly`: Flex items are evenly distributed along the main axis with equal space between items.
- `start`: Synonymous with `flex-start`.
