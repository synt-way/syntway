The `mask-border-repeat` CSS property is used to control how a mask border image is repeated along the border of an element when using the `mask-border` property. It defines the repetition behavior of the mask border image, allowing you to create various patterns and effects.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the `mask-border-repeat` property using the provided template:

### **What is `mask-border-repeat`?**
The `mask-border-repeat` property in CSS is used to define how a mask border image is repeated along the border of an element when using the `mask-border` property. It specifies the repetition behavior of the mask border image.

### **Usage:**
The syntax for using the `mask-border-repeat` property is as follows:

```css
selector {
  mask-border-repeat: values;
}
```

Where `selector` is the target element, and `values` represent one or more keywords that define the repetition behavior.

### **Example:**
```css
.element {
  mask-border: url('mask-image.png') 10 fill;
  mask-border-repeat: round;
}
```

In the example above, the `.element` will have a mask border applied from the `mask-image.png` with a 10px slice, and the mask border image will be repeated using a "round" repetition behavior.

### **Values of `mask-border-repeat`:**
- `repeat`: The mask border image is repeated in both horizontal and vertical directions.
- `repeat-x`: The mask border image is repeated only horizontally.
- `repeat-y`: The mask border image is repeated only vertically.
- `stretch`: The mask border image is stretched to fill the entire border area.
- `round`: The mask border image is repeated and stretched as needed to fill the border area without clipping.

### **Why Use `mask-border-repeat`?**
The `mask-border-repeat` property allows you to control how a mask border image is repeated along the border. This enables you to create different visual effects and patterns on the element's border.

### **Where to Use `mask-border-repeat`?**
Use the `mask-border-repeat` property in conjunction with the `mask-border` property on elements where you want to apply a mask border image and control its repetition behavior.

### **How to Use `mask-border-repeat`:**
1. Choose the appropriate repetition behavior for the mask border image.
2. Apply the `mask-border-repeat` property to the element, specifying the desired value.

### **Example Values:**
- `mask-border-repeat: repeat;`: Repeats the mask border image both horizontally and vertically.
- `mask-border-repeat: repeat-x;`: Repeats the mask border image only horizontally.
- `mask-border-repeat: repeat-y;`: Repeats the mask border image only vertically.

- `mask-border-repeat: round;`: Repeats and stretches the mask border image to fit without clipping.

### **SEO Considerations:**
The `mask-border-repeat` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. It's primarily used for styling and visual effects.

### **Additional Notes:**
- The `mask-border-repeat` property is used in combination with the `mask-border` property.
- Different values of `mask-border-repeat` can produce varying visual outcomes.

### **Browser Support:**
The `mask-border-repeat` property is supported in modern browsers. As always, it's recommended to test in different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
