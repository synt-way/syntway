The `background-repeat` property in CSS is used to control how a background image is repeated within an element's content box. It determines whether and how the background image is tiled or repeated to cover the available space.

**Example:**
```css
.tile-background {
  background-image: url('pattern.jpg');
  background-repeat: repeat; /* Repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically */
}
```

**Why:**
The `background-repeat` property is used to control the appearance of background images. It's particularly useful when you want to create a seamless pattern or tile a background image to fill the entire element.

**Where:**
Apply the `background-repeat` property to elements that have background images and where you want to control how those images are repeated.

**How:**
The `background-repeat` property accepts values that define how the background image is repeated:
- `repeat`: The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically.
- `repeat-x`: The background image is repeated only horizontally.
- `repeat-y`: The background image is repeated only vertically.
- `no-repeat`: The background image is not repeated.

**SEO:**
The `background-repeat` property itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, using it to enhance the visual design of your website can contribute to a more engaging user experience.

**Additional Notes:**
- The default value is `repeat`.
- If the background image is not large enough to fill the entire element, it will be tiled to cover the available space based on the `background-repeat` property value.

**Browser Support:**
The `background-repeat` property is widely supported in all modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It provides consistent behavior across these browsers.
