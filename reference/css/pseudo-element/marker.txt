As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the `::marker` pseudo-element is a relatively new feature in CSS that allows you to style the marker (usually a list item marker such as a bullet or number) of a list item. This pseudo-element gives you more control over the appearance of list item markers in ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

**Syntax:**
The `::marker` pseudo-element is used to style the marker of a list item and is typically combined with other CSS properties to define the styles. Here's an example:

```css
li::marker {
  /* CSS styles here */
}
```

**Example:**
Consider the following HTML and CSS:

```html
<ul>
  <li class="custom-marker">List item 1</li>
  <li>List item 2</li>
</ul>
```

```css
.custom-marker::marker {
  content: "•";
  color: red;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

In this example, the `::marker` pseudo-element is used to style the marker (bullet) of the first list item with the class `custom-marker`. It changes the marker to a red dot (•) and increases its font size.

**Why Use `::marker` Pseudo-Element:**
The `::marker` pseudo-element is used to customize the appearance of list item markers, allowing you to create custom bullets, numbers, or symbols to match your design requirements.

**Where to Use `::marker` Pseudo-Element:**
You should use the `::marker` pseudo-element in your CSS stylesheets to style list item markers within ordered and unordered lists.

**How `::marker` Pseudo-Element Works:**
The `::marker` pseudo-element selects the marker of a list item and allows you to apply CSS properties like `content`, `color`, `font-size`, `list-style-type`, and `list-style-image` to customize its appearance.

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Considerations:**
Using the `::marker` pseudo-element doesn't have a direct impact on SEO, as it primarily deals with the presentation of list item markers. However, it can enhance the visual appeal and readability of lists, which may indirectly improve user engagement and SEO.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `::marker` pseudo-element is supported in modern web browsers, but you should always check for the latest browser compatibility information.
- It's important to consider accessibility when customizing list item markers to ensure that they remain clear and distinguishable for all users.
- You can use `::marker` with ordered lists (`<ol>`) to style numbers or other characters and with unordered lists (`<ul>`) to style bullets or symbols.
- The `list-style-type` and `list-style-image` properties of the parent `<ul>` or `<ol>` element may affect the behavior of the `::marker` pseudo-element.

**Browser Support:**
Support for the `::marker` pseudo-element is generally good in modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11 and later. However, browser support and specific styling options may vary, so it's important to test your styles across different browsers to ensure consistent rendering.
