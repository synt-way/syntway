The `<summary>` element is used in conjunction with the `<details>` element to provide a visible label or summary for a disclosure widget, allowing users to toggle the visibility of additional content. It's commonly used to create collapsible sections that reveal more information when clicked or activated.

**1. What is the `<summary>` Element?**
The `<summary>` element is used to provide a visible label or summary for a disclosure widget created using the `<details>` element. It allows users to toggle the visibility of additional content.

**2. Why Use the `<summary>` Element?**
