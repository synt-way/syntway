The `<big>` element you mentioned is no longer part of the HTML specification. It was used in older versions of HTML to increase the font size of text. However, the `<big>` element has been deprecated, and its use is not recommended in modern HTML.

Instead of using the `<big>` element, it's recommended to use CSS to control the font size of text. CSS provides more flexibility and control over the appearance of text on your web page.

Here's a brief explanation of using CSS for font size control, along with the topics you requested:

**1. How to Control Font Size Using CSS:**
To control the font size of text using CSS, you can use the `font-size` property. You can specify the font size using various units such as pixels, ems, or percentages.

```html
<p style="font-size: 18px;">This is larger text using CSS.</p>
```

**2. Why Avoid the `<big>` Element:**
The `<big>` element has been deprecated because it separates the content's presentation from its structure. Using CSS for styling keeps the presentation layer separate from the semantic structure of the content, which is considered a better practice in modern web development.

**3. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and Font Size:**
The font size itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, maintaining a readable and appropriate font size is important for user experience and accessibility, which indirectly affect SEO.

**4. Additional Notes:**
- Responsiveness: When setting font sizes using CSS, consider responsive design principles to ensure your content remains readable across different devices and screen sizes.
- Semantic HTML: Focus on using semantic HTML elements to structure your content, and use CSS for styling.

**5. Browser Support:**
CSS for font size control is widely supported by all modern web browsers. Using CSS properties like `font-size` provides consistent behavior and appearance across various platforms and devices.

In modern web development, it's recommended to use CSS for styling, including font size control, rather than using deprecated HTML elements like `<big>`. This approach keeps your codebase cleaner, improves maintainability, and allows for better control over the visual presentation of your content.
