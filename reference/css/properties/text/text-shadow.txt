Certainly! Let's explore the CSS property `text-shadow` and its various aspects:

**What is `text-shadow`?**
`text-shadow` is a CSS property used to add shadow effects to text. It allows you to create visual effects by adding one or more shadows to text characters, making the text appear as if it's casting a shadow.

**Why is `text-shadow` used?**
`text-shadow` is used to enhance the visual appearance of text on a web page. It can be applied to create various visual effects, improve readability, and add depth or emphasis to text.

**Where is `text-shadow` applied?**
You can apply the `text-shadow` property to any HTML element containing text, such as headings, paragraphs, or inline text elements.

**How to use `text-shadow` with examples:**
Here are some examples of how to use `text-shadow`:

1. Create a subtle shadow effect with a slight blur:
   ```css
   .subtle-shadow {
     text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
   }
   ```

2. Add multiple shadows to create a more complex effect:
   ```css
   .complex-shadow {
     text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5), -2px -2px 4px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
   }
   ```

3. Create an embossed text effect with both positive and negative shadows:
   ```css
   .embossed-text {
     text-shadow: 1px 1px 0px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5), -1px -1px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
   }
   ```

**SEO implications:**
The `text-shadow` property itself does not have a direct impact on SEO (Search Engine Optimization). SEO primarily involves optimizing content, meta tags, and other factors to improve a website's visibility in search engine results. However, using `text-shadow` can indirectly affect SEO by enhancing the visual appeal and user experience of your content, potentially leading to lower bounce rates and increased engagement.

**Additional Notes:**
- `text-shadow` can accept values for horizontal and vertical offsets, blur radius, color, and multiple shadows separated by commas.
- The use of `text-shadow` should be applied thoughtfully to avoid excessive or distracting effects that may reduce readability.
- Browser support for `text-shadow` is generally good in modern browsers, but older browsers may have limited or no support. Always consider browser compatibility when using this property.

**Browser Support:**
Browser support for `text-shadow` is widely available in modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer. However, for consistent results, it's advisable to test and fine-tune `text-shadow` styles across various browsers, especially if complex or layered shadow effects are used.
