**CSS Fragmentation**

**What:**
CSS fragmentation refers to the control of how content is divided and displayed across multiple pages, columns, or regions when content overflows a container or needs to be split for printing or multi-column layouts.

**Example:**
Here's an example of using the `break-*` properties to control fragmentation in a multi-column layout:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .multi-column {
    column-count: 3;
    column-gap: 20px;
    break-inside: avoid; /* Prevent content from breaking within columns */
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="multi-column">
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. ...</p>
  <!-- More content here -->
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Why:**
CSS fragmentation is used to control the behavior of content when it spans multiple pages, columns, or other layout regions. It's essential for maintaining the visual coherence of content and preventing awkward splits or breaks.

**Where:**
CSS fragmentation properties are used primarily in scenarios involving multi-column layouts, print stylesheets, and paged media.

**How:**
Use properties like `break-before`, `break-after`, `break-inside`, `column-count`, `column-gap`, `page-break-before`, `page-break-after`, and more to control fragmentation behavior.

**SEO:**
CSS fragmentation itself doesn't have a direct impact on SEO. However, proper handling of content fragmentation, especially for print styles or multi-column layouts, can contribute to a better user experience, potentially influencing user engagement and indirectly affecting SEO.

**Additional Notes:**
- When designing for print or multi-column layouts, test the fragmentation behavior to ensure content splits are logical and visually pleasing.
- Media queries can be used to apply specific styles for printing, allowing you to control how content is fragmented on paper.
- Fragmentation properties might behave differently in different browsers and environments.

**Browser Support:**
CSS fragmentation properties are supported by modern browsers, but there might be variations in behavior across different browsers. Fragmentation properties are particularly useful for paged media, such as print styles. Always test your fragmentation styles across different browsers and environments to ensure consistent behavior.
