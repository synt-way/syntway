The `@font-palette-values` at-rule in CSS is used to define named font palettes, which are collections of font families that can be used for text rendering on a web page. It allows you to define and manage font fallbacks and prioritize fonts based on your design preferences. This feature is particularly useful for controlling typography and ensuring consistent font usage across a website.

Here's a detailed explanation of `@font-palette-values`:

**Syntax:**
The `@font-palette-values` rule is used to define font palettes:

```css
@font-palette-values Identifier {
  /* Font palette definitions */
}
```

- `Identifier`: Specifies a unique name for the font palette.
- `Font palette definitions`: Define font families and their properties within the palette.

**Example:**
Suppose you want to define a font palette named "PrimaryFontPalette" that includes two font families, "Arial" and "Helvetica Neue," with specific font weights and styles. You can define the palette like this:

```css
@font-palette-values PrimaryFontPalette {
  Arial: {
    400: normal; /* Font weight 400 with normal style */
  },
  "Helvetica Neue": {
    400: normal,
    700: bold /* Font weights 400 with normal style and 700 with bold style */
  }
}
```

In this example, we define the "PrimaryFontPalette" with two font families, specifying font weights and styles for each.

The use of `@font-palette-values` does not have a direct impact on SEO. SEO primarily focuses on content, structure, and metadata to improve a website's search engine ranking. However, maintaining consistent and readable typography can indirectly enhance the user experience and potentially contribute to SEO.
