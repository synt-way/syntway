Certainly! Let's explore the CSS property `text-size-adjust` and its various aspects:

**What is `text-size-adjust`?**
`text-size-adjust` is a CSS property used to control the size adjustment of text characters within web pages when a user zooms in or out of the content. It allows web developers to maintain consistent text legibility and prevent text from becoming too small or too large during browser zooming.

**Why is `text-size-adjust` used?**
`text-size-adjust` is used to ensure that text remains readable and visually comfortable for users when they zoom in or out of a web page. It helps maintain a consistent and user-friendly reading experience regardless of the zoom level.

**Where is `text-size-adjust` applied?**
You can apply the `text-size-adjust` property to any HTML element containing text content, such as headings, paragraphs, or inline text elements. It is commonly used to control text size adjustments in responsive web design.

**How to use `text-size-adjust` with examples:**
Here is an example of how to use `text-size-adjust`:

```css
/* Prevent text size adjustment during browser zooming */
.prevent-text-adjust {
  text-size-adjust: 100%;
}
```

In this example, `text-size-adjust` is set to `100%`, which means that the text size will not be adjusted when the user zooms in or out. It maintains the original text size regardless of the zoom level.

**SEO implications:**
The `text-size-adjust` property itself does not have a direct impact on SEO (Search Engine Optimization). SEO primarily involves optimizing content, meta tags, and other factors to improve a website's visibility in search engine results. However, using `text-size-adjust` can indirectly improve SEO by enhancing the user experience and ensuring that text remains readable, potentially leading to lower bounce rates and increased engagement.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `text-size-adjust` property helps address issues related to text becoming too small or too large during browser zooming, which can negatively affect user experience, especially on mobile devices.
- The default value for `text-size-adjust` is typically `auto`, which allows the browser to adjust text size during zooming based on its default settings. Setting it to `100%` prevents this adjustment.
- While `text-size-adjust` can be helpful, it's essential to consider other responsive design techniques and accessibility best practices to ensure a comprehensive user experience.

**Browser Support:**
Browser support for `text-size-adjust` is generally good in modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer. However, keep in mind that specific browser behavior and support may vary, so thorough testing across different browsers and devices is advisable when using this property for responsive web design.
